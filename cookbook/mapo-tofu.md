1. heat up skillet and coat evenly with a thin layer of avocado oil
2. add the minced garlic, ginger, Sichuan peppercorns, and chili oil and stir until fragrant
3. add ground pork, and mash into small pieces. stir until fully cooked
4. add Doubanjiang, chicken broth, and cornstarch (optional, include it if you want a paste-like consistency) and mix with ground pork

### notes
- I typically get the ground pork from 99 Ranch.
- This usually serves as an additional meal for extra protein, rather than a standalone meal.
