### ingredients
- halibut fillets (~1 lb)
- grape tomatoes (~10 total)
- 1/2 red onion
- lemon
- parsley
- garlic powder
- black pepper
- salt
- olive oil

### steps
1. preheat oven to 400 degrees
2. lay fillets on baking pan and add the following in order:

    - salt, ~1/4 tsp sprinkled on fillets
    - lemon juice, from around 1/2 a lemon
    - garlic powder, sprinkled on fillets as needed
    - black pepper, sprinkled on fillets as needed
    - grape tomatoes, sliced in halves and spread out on top of fillets
    - red onion, diced and spread out on top of fillets
    - parsley, separate leaves and sprinkle on top as needed
    - olive oil, ~2 tbsp drizzled on top
3. bake for 20 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 145

### notes
- I add a bunch of toppings and olive oil on top to help the fillets retain their moisture and tenderness in the oven. Halibut tends to dry out easily.
- I use an [oil dispenser](https://www.crateandbarrel.com/glass-olive-oil-dispenser-bottle/s213109). Not only does it keep my kitchen looking organized, but it also controls the speed at which the oil is poured. I drizzle it liberally in a zigzag fashion.
- I grow my own parsley in my [garden](/plants)!

### serve with
- asparagus and white mushrooms, sautéed with olive oil, black pepper, and garlic powder
