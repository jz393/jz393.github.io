### ingredients
- 2 whole branzino fish
- 1 thumb of ginger, sliced into small pieces *(or minced if preferred)*
- green onion, 1/2 bunch
- soy sauce
- avocado oil

### steps
1. lay fish on steaming tray and add the following:

    - ginger pieces, some added inside fish (inside the cut belly) and some sprinkled on top
    - green onion, sliced into halves and into long vertical pieces
2. steam for 10-15 min depending on size of fish
3. remove excess water from tray
4. drizzle soy sauce (~4 tbsp) on top of fish
5. heat up avocado oil (~4 tbsp) and drizzle on top of fish

### notes
- This is the typical Chinese/Cantonese style of steaming fish.
- I get the fish from Whole Foods.

    - You can ask them to gut/descale/clean and cut off the head/tail.
- Sometimes I'll use a Chilean sea bass fillet instead.
- I use this [electric steamer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089SG9D1F/ref=dp_iou_view_item?ie=UTF8&th=1) with the included tray.

### serve with
- Chinese veggies, sautéed with minced garlic and avocado oil

    - I typically use bok choy, pea leaves, or water spinach.
