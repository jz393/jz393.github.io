2. slice/dice cucumbers into bite-sized pieces (any method/shape works) and place into large salad bowl
3. prepare the marinade by mixing everything below:

### notes
- You can get a 1 lb package of Persian cucumbers in most grocery stores. You can also use regular cucumbers, but I prefer them since they're easy to cut and don't have seeds.
