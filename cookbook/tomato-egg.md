### ingredients
- 3-4 vine tomatoes
- 3-4 large eggs
- 1/2 bunch of green onions, diced
- garlic (3-4 cloves), minced
- ground white pepper, ~1/4 tsp
- salt, ~3/4 tsp
- sesame oil

### steps
1. cut tomatoes into wedges and beat eggs into small bowl
2. heat up skillet and coat with a thin layer of sesame oil
3. place tomatoes and minced garlic onto hot skillet
4. add salt + white pepper and cook for around 5 min, stirring thoroughly
5. when tomatoes are somewhat liquified/mashed, move them to the side of pan, leaving enough space to add egg mixture
6. pour egg mixture onto the open space of the pan, scrambling them as they cook
7. when the eggs are sufficiently solid form, mix them into the tomatoes, making sure there are still some large egg pieces
8. sprinkle in green onions and serve

### notes
- I like to remove the center of the tomatoes when preparing.
- This usually serves as an additional meal for extra protein, rather than a standalone meal.
