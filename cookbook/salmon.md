### ingredients
- salmon fillets (~1 lb)
- lemon
- garlic powder
- black pepper
- salt
- soy sauce *(optional)*

### steps
1. preheat oven to 400 degrees
2. lay fillets on baking pan and add the following in order:

    - salt, ~1/4 tsp sprinkled on fillets
    - soy sauce, ~1/2 tsp *(optional, I add it sometimes for extra color / flavor)*
    - lemon juice, from around 1/2 a lemon
    - garlic powder, sprinkled on fillets as needed
    - black pepper, sprinkled on fillets as needed
3. bake for 20 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 145

### notes
- I like to use a [basting brush](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Cook-20316-Basting-Silicone/dp/B003XPH6UQ) for the soy sauce and lemon juice.
- You can add some lemon slices on top of the fillets for aesthetic purposes.

### serve with
