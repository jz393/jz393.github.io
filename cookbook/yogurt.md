### ingredients
- nonfat & unsweetened greek yogurt ([Siggi's](https://siggis.com/product/plain-nonfat/) is my favorite)
- honey (*optional*, am using organic wildflower honey from [Steve's Bees](https://www.stevesbees.co/))
- granola (*optional*, I like [Purely Elizabeth](https://purelyelizabeth.com/collections/granola-2) - am alternating between various flavors)
- various berries/fruits, washed and cut as needed

### steps
1. scoop yogurt (~3/4 cup) into bowl
2. add a pinch of honey if desired, and mix thoroughly to remove clumps in yogurt
3. sprinkle granola and berries on top

### notes
- This is my go-to whenever I'm craving something sweet!
- It's a great pre-workout snack: high in protein & calcium and providing glucose for an energy boost.
- I typically use blackberries and raspberries, as they are easy to prepare and low-GI.
