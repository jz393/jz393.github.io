### ingredients
- chicken thighs (~1 lb, or 4-6 pieces)
- lemon
- garlic powder
- black pepper
- paprika

### steps
1. preheat oven to 400 degrees
2. while oven is preheating, marinate the chicken with the following, mixed thoroughly:

    - salt, ~1/2 tsp
    - soy sauce, ~4 tbsp
    - juice from 1/2 a lemon
3. lay marinated chicken thighs on baking pan and sprinkle the following on top:

    - garlic powder, as needed
    - paprika, as needed

3. bake for 20 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 145
