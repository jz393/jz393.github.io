### ingredients
- 2-3 large Dungeness crabs
- 1 thumb of ginger, cut into 5-6 pieces
- 1/2 bunch of green onions, cut into halves
- soy sauce

### steps
1. clean crabs and place into steamer
2. add ginger and green onion on top as aromatics
3. steam for 10-15 min (making sure crab is fully red)
3. serve with soy sauce on the side

### notes
- I like to get crabs from Safeway, when they're on sale during the season. You can ask them to crack them for you.

    - Whole Foods works too, but I've found Safeway typically has better quality.
- Sometimes we go crabbing for fresh crabs! (really time consuming though)

### serve with
