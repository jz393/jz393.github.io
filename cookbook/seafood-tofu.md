### ingredients
- medium tofu (1 package)
- shiitake/enoki/oyster mushrooms (~5 oz)
- shellfish (e.g. oysters, clams, mussels)
- squid cutlets
- shrimp
- 1 yellow/sweet onion, diced
- 1 zucchini, diced
- sesame oil (~2 tbsp)
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp gochugaru (red chili flakes, found in most Asian supermarkets)
- low sodium chicken broth
- 1 egg *(optional)*
- green onion, 1/2 bunch *(optional)*
- salt to taste

### steps
1. heat up pot with seasame oil on the bottom
2. dice onion and add to pot, stir until soft
3. mix in oyster sauce, soy sauce, and gochugaru until combined
4. add chicken broth (~2-3 cups) depending on how much soup and what consistency you want
5. add vegetables (mushrooms/zucchini), tofu (cut into ~1 in cubes), and seafood (shellfish/squid/shrimp) to broth after it comes to a boil
6. bring to a boil and let simmer for ~5 min, or until everything is fully cooked (try not to overcook the seafood)
7. season with salt to taste, cracked egg *(optional)*, and green onion *(optional)*



### notes
- This is a traditionally Korean dish, called *soondubu jjigae*.
- It's great for throwing together various seafood/shellfish all at once! I used to make cioppino, but it was a bit too creamy/buttery for my dietary preferences.
- You can get various frozen seafood in most Asian supermarkets (I typically use 99 Ranch or Weee!), or fresh seafood at Whole Foods if preferred.
- I like soft tofu more, but a firmer one is preferred here since it's less likely to break apart when mixed with all the shellfish.
