### ingredients
- pork bones (1-1.5 lbs)
- 1 thumb of ginger, cut into 5-6 pieces
- green onions (1 bunch), cut into 2-3 in pieces
- salt, ~3 tsp (or to taste)
- *additional toppings (mix and match as desired)*:

    - *wintermelon, thinly sliced*
    - *daikon radish, thinly sliced*
    - *woodear*
    - *enoki mushrooms*
    - *dried shrimp*
    - *goji berries*
    - *vermicelli*

### steps
1. place pork bones into stockpot, and submerge them in water.
2. bring to boil, and cook for 10 minutes
3. place pork bones into new stockpot and fill with clean water

    - alternatively, you can wash and reuse existing stockpot; just make sure to replace the dirty water
4. place ginger slices into pot and add salt
5. bring to boil, then cook on medium for ~15-20 min

    - make sure to remove excess foam on top
6. add green onions and additional toppings as needed (considering how long it takes to cook each topping)

    - simmer on low for ~1 hr
7. serve broth and toppings into soup bowls, and pork bones on the side with soy sauce

### notes
- Feel free to simmer it even longer for more taste.
- I typically get the pork bones from 99 Ranch (they sell packs of it).
- This is a great source of collagen, and can be used as the base for homemade hotpot!
