### ingredients
- vine tomatoes (~1 lb)
- soft tofu (1 package)
- shiitake/enoki/oyster (~5 oz)
- low sodium chicken broth
- sesame oil (~2 tbsp)
- green onion, 1/2 bunch *(optional)*
- salt to taste

### steps
1. heat up pot with seasame oil on the bottom
2. dice the tomatoes up into small-ish cubes, and place into pot
3. stir accordingly until you get a paste-like consistency
4. slice/cut mushrooms into thin pieces and add to pot, stir until incorporated
5. add chicken broth (~2-3 cups) depending on how much soup and what consistency you want
6. cut tofu into small (~1 in) cubes and place into pot after the broth comes to a boil
7. add green onion and salt to taste


### notes
- I like the remove the center of the tomato, as well as stems from shiitake mushrooms when preparing.
- I used to add eggs (instead of tofu) as this is a more common Chinese dish, but wanted to find a way to increase protein while lowering dietary cholesterol.
- I sometimes subsitute mushrooms with [dried seaweed](https://click.sayweee.com/en/grocery-near-me/lang-en/user-onboard/paid?forceSkuQueryReferer=74354&sData=74354&region_id=000001).
