### ingredients
- 3 large eggs, mixed OR ~3/4 cups liquid egg product
- any combination of veggies:

    - spinach or arugula
    - grape tomatoes
    - mushrooms (baby bella or white)
    - avocado
- smoked salmon
- black pepper
- salt
- olive oil

### steps
1. heat up skillet and add olive oil to coat evenly
2. pour mixed eggs into skillet, sprinkle salt and pepper to taste
3. scramble and transfer out when mostly dried but still soft
4. serve with smoked salmon and veggies on the side

    - I'll either use a single sliced avocado (faster) or sautée any subset of {green veggies, grape tomatoes, mushrooms}

### notes
- This is the fastest and laziest breakfast/brunch I could come up with that's relatively nutritious, high in protein, and low in carbs.
- I like to use egg product (e.g., egg beaters) since it's faster and cholesterol and fat-free. However, real eggs provide a better nutritional profile, so use whatever's best for you.
