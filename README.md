To educate and make myself more well-rounded, I decided to create a personal resume-website in order to get some practice working with front-end development. This project has enabled me to learn new languages such as HTML/CSS/Js, and integrate my design interests with the technical side of things. Additionally, I thought this would be a fun way to finally learn git and make my first GitHub repo :) I've never done any website-design stuff before, so I apologize for any styling errors in advance. This was customized to look the best for my 13-inch display Mac, but no guarantees for any other types of displays.

The css, html, and images files are mine. The JS and bootstrap were open-sourced code from Colorlib.
