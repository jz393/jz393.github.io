Hello! Reflecting on my CS skills, I feel as if I lack front end experience. Therefore, to educate and 
make myself more well-rounded, I decided to create a personal resume-website in order to get some practice 
working with front-end development. This project has enabled me to learn new languages such as HTML/CSS/Js, 
and integrate my design interests with the technical side of things. I used Photoshop to make a lot of the 
background photos. Additionally, I thought this would be a fun way to finally learn git and make my first 
GitHub repo :) I've never done any front-end stuff before, so I apologize for any styling errors in advance.
