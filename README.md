# jz393.github.io

To get some practice working with front-end, I created a personal portfolio site, integrating my design + technical interests. Additionally, I thought this would be a fun way to make my first GitHub repo :)

Disclaimer: I made changes to css, html, and image files. Icons, bootstrap, and Js animations are Colorlib's open-source [credits in comments]
