I created a personal portfolio site, integrating my design + technical interests. This is my first GitHub repo (from May 2018), and became my practice for using git! :)

May 2019 Update: For my website's 1 year anniversary, I got a custom domain [zhangjane.com]! 

Disclaimer: Bootstrap and JS files + site template is from Colorlib.com.
