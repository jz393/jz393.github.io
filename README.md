# jz393.github.io --> zhangjane.com

I created a personal portfolio site, integrating my design + technical interests. This is my first GitHub repo (from around June 2018), and became my practice for using git! :)

May 2019 Update: Just got a custom domain <zhangjane.com>! 

Disclaimer: I made changes to css, html, and image files. Icons, bootstrap, and Js animations are Colorlib's open-source [credits in comments]
