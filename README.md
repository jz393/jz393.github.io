# jz393.github.io

To get some practice working with front-end, I created a personal resume-website. This project has enabled me to learn new languages such as HTML/CSS/Js, and integrate my design + technical interests. Additionally, I thought this would be a fun way to finally learn git and make my first GitHub repo :) This was customized to look the best for my 13-inch display Mac, but no guarantees for any other types of displays. I've never done any website-design stuff before, and am still figuring it out as I go along!

Css, html, and all image files are mine. Icons, bootstrap, and Js animations were Colorlib's open-source [credits in code comments]
