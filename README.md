# jz393.github.io

To get some practice working with front-end, I created a personal portfolio site, integrating my design + technical interests. Additionally, I thought this would be a fun way to make my first GitHub repo :) This was customized to look the best for my 13-inch Macbook display, but no guarantees for any other types of displays. I'm still figuring it out as I go along!
