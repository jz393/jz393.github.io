the incandescent glow of youth  
under luscious willow trees  
riding bikes by the lake  
you comforted me when i scraped my knee  

we eventually grew up  
we gossiped about scandals  
we mocked haughty politicians  
we questioned our existence  

fearing a Shakespearean tragedy  
i said i needed to go  
and you let me  
i left and never looked back  

thousands of miles away  
i met someone else  
still, i remembered you  
in ancient libraries beneath decrepit books  

nearly a decade later  
my first destroyed me  
ashes and embers in my hair  
i believed i would never breathe again  

empty thoughts, empty ambitions  
months of mindless distractions  
aimlessly wandering downtown  
i noticed you in a small cafe  

we caught up quickly  
i spoke for the first time  
i laughed for the first time  
you rebuild without erasing  

no longer eighteen and naive  
i know love does not last  
but with you, the present is frozen  
in cycles of stories and sketches  

we can be Romeo and Juliet   
into midlife and beyond  
i will take anything  

as long as  
i have  
you  


*To my second love: Thank you for making life worth living again.*
