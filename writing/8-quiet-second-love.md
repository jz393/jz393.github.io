the incandescent glow of youth  
under luscious willow trees  
riding bikes near the lake  
you comforted me when i scraped my knee  

we eventually grew up  
we gossiped about scandals  
we mocked haughty politicians  
we questioned our existence  

fearing a Shakespearean tragedy  
we decided to part ways  
i told you i received a call  
i left and never looked back  

thousands of miles away  
i met someone else  
still, i remembered you occasionally  
in ancient libraries under decaying books  

nearly a decade later  
my first destroyed me  
ashes and embers in my hair  
i believed i would never breathe again  

empty thoughts, empty ambitions  
months of mindless distractions  
aimlessly wandering town again  
i noticed you in a small cafe  

we caught up quickly  
i spoke for the first time  
i laughed for the first time  
you rebuilt without erasing  

no longer eighteen and naive  
i know love doesn’t last  
with you, the present is frozen  
in cycles of stories and sketches  

we can be Romeo and Juliet forever  
into the midlife and beyond  
i’ll take anything  
as long as i have you  

*To my second love: Thank you for allowing me to reason again, without discarding what once was.*
