the incandescent glow of youth  
riding bikes by the lake  
under weeping willow trees  
you comforted me when i scraped my knee  

we eventually grew up  
we gossiped about scandals  
we mocked haughty politicians  
we questioned our existence  

fearing a Shakespearean tragedy  
we decided to part ways  
i told you i received a call  
i left and never looked back  

thousands of miles away  
i met someone else  
still, i saw you occasionally  
in ancient libraries around decrepit books  

nearly a decade passed  
my first destroyed me  
ashes and embers in my hair  
i believed i would never breathe again  

empty thoughts, empty ambitions  
months of mindless distractions  
aimlessly wandering town again  
i noticed you in a small cafe  

we caught up quickly  
i spoke for the first time  
i laughed for the first time  
you rebuilt without erasing  

no longer eighteen and naive  
i know love doesn’t last  
with you, the present is frozen  
in daytime stories and nighttime sketches

we can be Romeo and Juliet forever  
into the midlife and beyond  
anything is okay with me  

as long as  
i have  
you  


*To my second love: Thank you for making life worth living again.*
