Recently, I committed to my health above all else. I’m not sure what exactly prompted this—maybe the existential dread I felt on my 25th birthday, the classic marker for the quarter-life crisis, or simply the heartache of seeing brilliant colleagues place career advancement above well-being. Or perhaps it was the sheer horror I experienced after getting married, when I realized I would probably have biological kids one day (and therefore be the one responsible for carrying & delivering them).

[Leaving my 9-5 behind](https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-and-deepmind), I took on a singular mission to focus on my well-being. It has been about 5 months now, and I will document my progress so far.

## Covering the bases
Good things come in threes. Luckily, this includes our foundation for health: sleep, food, and exercise. 

### Sleep
Towards the end of my stint on Gemini, my sleep took the first hit. It all started the night before a big presentation, when I tossed and turned and slept for a handful of hours. The presentation thankfully went well, but a barrage of tasks kept me from relaxing afterwards. As a result, my sleep the next night suffered too. I don’t remember much more specifics, just that this led to a vicious cycle for around a month, and I eventually found myself unable to doze off for more than 1-2 hours a night.

Through sheer discipline alone, I could usually force myself to eat (or not eat) something, perform a particular exercise, or complete one of the many tasks on my TODO list. But the one thing I couldn’t brute-force was sleep. However, that didn’t stop me from trying—I saw multiple doctors, who each prescribed me concoctions of sleep aids that I couldn’t pronounce. Some knocked me out the first few days, but my sleep would gradually revert to its fragmented, fragile state. Others felt nothing more than a sugar pill, designed by Big Pharma to prey upon the masses.

Still, I downed the prescriptions each night an hour before midnight, and they rationed me a measly few hours of shut-eye to face the grind of yet another day. I couldn’t even take naps, as I was psychologically reliant on the pills. Nothing seemed to work, and I felt unfixable.

One evening, on a getaway to Napa, I lay down on our Airbnb bed and closed my eyes just for the fun of it. I’ll never forget the jarring imagery of a Medusa head with the face of Jesus. I jolted awake and sprinted around the cabin in delight, screaming with joy. I had a *dream* (and quite a strange one), which meant I finally slept (without having taken my nightly pill yet)! At that moment, I realized I was capable of sleeping, as long as I could find a way to relax.

In the months that followed, I left my job and found intentional ways to enjoy life. My sleep gradually recovered, and I weaned myself off the pills. I wouldn’t say that it’s perfect, but it’s comparable to what it was before the whole fiasco. My wearables, described below, also lifted the mental load of meticulous sleep tracking. I don’t put too much pressure on myself to hit a perfect number each night; I now trust my body to get the rest it needs (usually between 7 and 9 hours) after each day's varied demands. As long as I have the energy to do what needs to be done, I don’t harp on it. And even if I don’t, I’ll just take a nap. It’s not like we had polysomnography or even clocks as hunters and gatherers; we simply rested whenever we needed to. 

### Nutrition
My first health panel flagged slight issues with glucose and cholesterol management. My A1C was 5.7, bordering on prediabetes. Now this wasn’t too surprising—I figured my weekly pastry haul, ice cream/boba adventures, and sweets at work wouldn’t be sustainable forever. I just thought I had a couple more years left.

The first thing I did was cut out carbs entirely. Upon getting my labs back, I (sadly) cleared my snack cabinet and freezer. I replaced my breakfast pastries with scrambled eggs. I swapped my jasmine rice for basmati and ate only a quarter of what I would typically have for dinner. Consequently, my dopamine levels nosedived, and I felt empty.

This went on for a couple of months, but without the sugary reward system in place and my sleep getting worse, I just didn’t have the capacity to care anymore. I returned to my pastries to emotionally numb myself, but with some newfound guilt lingering in the back of my head.

Eventually, I took another test and got a 6.0. Now this was the unequivocal prediabetes range, and I was quickly heading towards the real thing. Additionally, I had forgotten entirely about the cholesterol issue; my first LDL was 108—again, borderline unhealthy but not too extreme. However, in my carb-management journey, I quickly began substituting butter for sugar for my dopamine hit. My next LDL reading was 131, and my total and non-HDL cholesterol levels were now out of range as well.

I knew I had to make drastic lifestyle changes at this point. We couldn’t rely on outdoor dining anymore, unless I wanted to get a salad every time. I began researching healthier options and which nutrients to optimize. I landed on a mostly pescatarian, chicken-based diet (lean, non-red meats) and a relatively consistent breakfast of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon.

I also had a phase where I obsessed over supplements, but I’ve found it easier (and cheaper) just to obtain most nutrients from actual food. The only ones I take now are vitamin D in the morning and magnesium glycinate before bed, along with the occasional melatonin for sleep as needed.

### Fitness
For context, I was terrible at sports and relatively inactive since I was a kid. I wish I could go back in time and undo the inactivity in my youth. Second-best option? Start now, in my mid-twenties.

I started running at work, carving out hourly “gym” blocks on my calendar, primarily to help manage my glucose and cholesterol. It was very rough at first; I couldn’t even run for more than 2-3 minutes without getting out of breath. The last time I seriously ran was in middle school, for our Texas standardized fitness testing, which contained the benchmark of 16 minutes for one mile (4 laps). Back then, even that seemed impossible; I would constantly “cheat” by completing only three laps, and my time was still so horrendous that it seemed believable.

With enough sessions, I got better. I overcame the initial shin splints and bought myself a pair of HOKA shoes. I maintained a steady routine: trekking to the Google gym during breaks between afternoon meetings, changing into workout clothes, and running a mile straight on the treadmill while occasionally answering pings on my phone.

However, in parallel with my dietary journey, with the stress and sleep deprivation building up, I simply lost the energy to care. My cortisol levels were through the roof, and I didn’t feel like messing with them even further. For a few months, all I could manage was the occasional walk while zoning out and blasting music in the background—still better than nothing, though.

After leaving Google, I got a gym membership and started running on the treadmills again. Thankfully, the initial progress I made wasn’t completely lost; I could still run a mile straight without getting too out of breath. I learned more about the cardio zones and decided that a mix of zones 2 and 3 was best suited to my needs.

I must admit, though, going to the gym every day was really boring. The place is dull and filled with monotonous *gym bros*. Also, the drive took nearly 30 minutes each way. I quickly got tired of it and instead opted for hikes at the Stanford Dish (much closer to where I live). I was walking instead of running, but many parts were extremely steep, and my heart rate rose enough to match a mile of running. Furthermore, the hills were breathtakingly scenic, and I enjoyed being in the sun.

For several weeks, hiking at the Dish became the extent of my exercise routine. Unfortunately, the constant uphill climb and the lack of concentrated cardio brought some setbacks. My baseline glucose levels rose significantly without a change in diet, and my VO2max scores tanked. My feet also started to hurt all the time.

As a result, I started to run in my local community park, aiming for the best of both worlds (no lengthy traffic, plus exposure to the outdoors). With shorter but more concentrated and consistent exercise, my VO2max/glucose/foot pain have normalized again over the course of a month. I still go to the gym 1-2 times a week for strength training (and if it gets too dark for me to exercise). I also don’t have any specific fitness goals beyond being healthy (rather than aiming for particular PRs), so my routine is more flexible than one might expect.

## Leveraging the tech
Alas, we live in a (tech-obsessed) society, and my health journey doesn’t exist in a vacuum. With so many modern options for tracking our wellness, I wonder if we even have an excuse not to be healthy these days. At the same time, with the constant influx of numbers and figures, it’s hard to know what to prioritize.

### Apple Watch
I received my first Apple Watch as a Christmas present in college. Back then, all I cared about was getting through my classes. I used it primarily to ping my phone, relieved I didn’t have to keep track of it anymore. Also, getting instant notifications on my wrist was nice, though often draining.

Admittedly, it did bring some awareness to my sedentary habits. I now had the three activity rings glaring in front of me, which provided *some* motivation, just enough for me to remember to get up and stretch my legs for a bit or go on a brief walk. Nonetheless, the rings remained largely unclosed as life constantly stood in the way.

It was only recently that I started integrating my watch as a core tool in my health and fitness journey. I realized that, in addition to the three rings, it provided many more insights on various cardio metrics (RHR, HRV, VO2max) and other activity metrics (daily steps, calories burned). I also started wearing it at night to methodically track my sleep, instead of guesstimating each morning. 

Perhaps the most helpful aspect is the workout-friendly UI. You can start a workout (choose from dozens of options) and track your progress and heart rate in real time. It’s been beneficial for pacing myself on runs, making sure I stay in the proper zone.

### Oura Ring
Frustrated with my watch’s tendency to overcount my sleep, its interference with my z’s with the constant pinging, and the general fashion distaste (I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fully get rid of the tan), my eyes landed on OURA. I got the ring in gold to match my other jewelry—much more tasteful than a bulky watch!

Three months later, my ring has become a core part of my everyday routine. To my surprise, it isn’t invasive at all. I was between sizes and settled on the larger size. I now alternate between my left index finger and thumb, depending on how loose I want it. The health metrics are diverse and reasonably accurate. The app is sleek and efficient. I eagerly check it each morning and before bed.

Unlike the Apple Watch, OURA’s three metrics feel more balanced: readiness, sleep, and activity. The watch’s main metrics, on the other hand, are all about activity—stand hours, calories burned, and exercise minutes. I like how the ring especially prioritizes rest and recovery, providing a detailed interface for HRV/stress tracking and sleep scores over time. Furthermore, each activity goal is customizable to that specific day’s readiness. Lastly, the sleep tracking (my primary motivator) is indeed more accurate. 

However, I still wear my Apple Watch during the daytime. The ring lacks an interface for on-the-go workout tracking, and it doesn’t integrate well with the Apple ecosystem. I need my watch to deliver notifications and keep track of my phone. It’s nice that I can leave it off when I go to sleep, and maybe for fancy events—if I can find some way to cover the unsightly tan.

### Freestyle Libre 3
When my A1C reached 6, my doctor prescribed me the Freestyle Libre for continuous glucose monitoring. I initially refused to wear it. I was scared of the needle, and having something inserted in my skin at all times seemed quite unpleasant.

After quitting my job, I felt like I had more bandwidth for physically unpleasant tasks (as long as they didn’t involve eval pipelines). I took the leap of faith and jabbed the applicator onto the back of my arm. Surprisingly, it wasn’t bad at all, only a tiny poke for a millisecond, and I couldn’t feel the sensor at all afterwards. It conveniently connected to an app on my phone via Bluetooth, and I now had insight into how each meal affected my bloodstream.

The first few weeks were *rough*. Seemingly innocuous meals like *soup dumplings* or *japchae* easily sent my blood sugar soaring to 200. I felt confined to a life of mixed greens and unseasoned fish/chicken.

Over time, I made progress across the three health pillars described above and was able to control my glucose levels, with room for the occasional sweet treat. Nowadays, I set my range to be 70-140, and rarely see readings beyond that (<3% of the time). Note that sometimes the readings aren’t super accurate, and I have a finger-prick test available on hand to double-check anything if needed.

Now I’m not diabetic, so technically I don’t *need* it; I’m grateful that I can get monthly refills in my situation. It’s been a nice addition to my life and health journey, similar to my watch and ring. 

## Challenges and lessons
I’m proud of the progress I’ve made so far, but like any journey worth taking, it hasn’t come without its fair share of obstacles in the winding path.

### Oh, the pains
Throughout my tech career and college days, I had constant back pain. I’m not sure if this was due to poor posture, stress, or lack of exercise. Regardless, it seems to be a common complaint among industry workers (which has led to the rise of ergonomics, with all the fancy office chairs and standing desks).

Now that I’m not hunched over a screen all day and getting more activity in, my back feels so much lighter. But instead of disappearing entirely, it seems that my pains have just moved to my feet.

As mentioned earlier, it started when I became more physically active (with daily runs and/or walks), and became exacerbated during my hiking era. In particular, the soreness concentrates on the arches of my feet. Maybe my form isn’t that great, or I need better-fitting shoes. Or perhaps I’m just not used to this new standard of activity I’ve been placing on myself.

Aside from the foot pain, I regularly get muscle soreness from my workouts, which is to be expected. I try to prioritize getting enough protein, but sometimes it takes several days to fully recover, which throws off my weeklong exercise routine. Sometimes I try to power through it, but oftentimes it just makes everything worse. I guess there’s simply no free lunch; as the saying goes, *no pain, no gain*.

### Too much information
Back in the day, people only saw doctors when something was *wrong*. Or maybe they would get a routine checkup and part with general advice on how to improve their health (less sugar, more exercise, etc.).

Now I have three wearables, along with free Internet access and access to various health forums. This seems like it should help (and it does, for the most part), but having 24/7 access to all this information is sometimes draining.

Instead of broadly following generic advice, we now have constant access to dozens of fine-grained metrics in real time. It feels like a déjà vu of high school, when life consisted purely of maximizing GPA and standardized test scores. Except this time, there are like 17 different metrics, and they don’t all align with one another. It resembles an intense game of whack-a-mole.

Plus, with so much content across many different media (AI, search, social media), it’s hard to reach a consensus on which metric matters most or the right path to get there. There are so many different recipes, articles, and perspectives. All you can really do is sift through the information and gradually find what works *for you* through trial and error.

### Finding a balance
If health were all about shoving veggies down your throat and forcing yourself to exercise, that would be great. I was used to brute-forcing my way to every accomplishment in my life, braving through pure exhaustion to reach beyond my means.

However, rest and recovery remain integral to health, as my OURA ring has reminded me. My HRV needs to be high enough. My recovery index needs to be sufficient to endure another day of training. Additionally, restrictive dieting (e.g., cutting out sugar entirely) just drains my energy and limits my plans; it’s much better to consume in moderation.

So instead of relying on the familiar habit of throwing discipline at my goals, I now seek a life of balance. I embrace pockets of peace and find contentment with *couch-rotting* at times. I am happy when my HRV skyrockets, even as my activity scores drop temporarily. Maybe health is more about harmony, rather than the sheer discipline we’ve always thought.

### Some things you can’t control
At the end of the day, there are just some things we can’t control. For example, the sleep issues I talked about earlier. Or the fact that sometimes, your resting heart rate or glucose levels will just rise for one night, even though you did everything right in the daytime, and you have no idea what just happened.

This is quite unsettling for the discipline-minded folks who like to throw effort into a problem and guarantee a specific result. But like most things in life, health isn’t so straightforward. There are simply actions you can take to increase the success rate.

Also, it’s essential not to be caught up in day-to-day ebbs and flows. Doing so will just drain your precious energy and lead to burnout. Don’t fixate on the endless data; just have faith in yourself that if you put in your best work, things will trend in the right direction over time. The long term is what matters, after all.

### Ignorance is NOT bliss
The “ignorance is bliss” saying is all too common, and might even be true a lot of the time. Digital media has exposed us to way too much information, probably beyond our ability to comprehend. But I don’t think it applies to something as precarious as health.

It’s helpful to be in the know, rather than being an ostrich burying its head in the sand in the presence of danger. It was undoubtedly alarming to receive my suboptimal health panels, compared to the first 25 years of my life, being blissfully unaware. But such a realization is inevitable, and the sooner you face it, the sooner you can overcome bad habits.

It doesn’t mean that we need (or should) be on all the time, constantly checking our health data and searching for ways to optimize our numbers. In fact, I think it’s healthy to take breaks and even opt out of the wearables/strict routines from time to time, for your mental sanity (unless you have diabetes and need the CGM). However, even just checking in from time to time is much better than nothing.

Generally, if you feel the need to avoid something out of fear (like I did), it’s a telltale sign that something is wrong. And you can only run away for so long.

## Conclusion
It’s been quite the journey prioritizing health and fitness in the era of rapid technological advancement. Leaving an engineering career, I still face everyday challenges, just as I did at work—incremental changes, trial and error, constant troubleshooting.

I am no stranger to cramming. I’ve historically relied on late-night sessions to prepare for exams, watching a whole semester’s worth of lectures in a week while I've zoned out in (or even skipped) the actual classes. Now, I need to make up for a quarter-century of blissful unawareness about my diet and activity.

However, I can take comfort in knowing that my efforts will last this time, unlike the fleeting A in my algorithms course. There is no more important pillar than health; it is the foundation for all of our other earthly endeavors.

As I grocery shop with these goals in mind, prepare each meal from scratch, and cozy up under the warm glow of the Christmas tree lights afterwards, I’m thankful to have found a new dedication to wellness. I now wake up each day, hopeful for a brighter, more sustainable future.
