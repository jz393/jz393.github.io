I'm Jane, a former software and machine learning engineer at [Google](https://about.google/) and [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), where I worked on [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/). After four years there, preceded by two summer internships during my time at [Cornell](https://www.cornell.edu), I left Alphabet this past summer. Here, I share my experience and reasons for leaving.

Many "Why I Left Google" essays exist; mine simply organizes my personal thoughts. I cover my background, pros and cons of working at Google and DeepMind, reasons for leaving, and next steps. Thanks to Deedy's [post](https://debarghyadas.com/writes/why-i-left-google/) for structural inspiration.


## [1] My time at Google

I want to preface this by saying Google has been integral to both my college experience and young adult life. It was tough to say goodbye to something I had considered as a core part of both my professional and personal identity. After all, it had been my dream company ever since I started studying computer science.

### Background and timeline
- **The interview (2018):** I was shocked when a recruiter reached out to schedule an interview during a busy sophomore semester. Thanks to summer practice, I solved the first question quickly. I struggled with the second, but remembered *DFAs* right before time ran out and submitted a rough solution. Although I thought I'd failed, my recruiter called the next day with the good news. I eagerly accepted the offer, and team matching quickly followed as I began preparing for my internship.
- **First internship, Cloud (2019):** Starting at Google and living in SF was exciting. My co-interns and I enthusiastically explored the city and the office together, and we attended many fun intern events. Overcoming the initial learning curve of Google’s vast infrastructure, I finished my project ahead of schedule with my team's support and learned a great deal about the company.
- **Second internship, Ads (2020):** Due to COVID, I worked remotely from my apartment in Ithaca. This time, things were considerably more serious and focused. I gained practical full-stack experience and learned more about the long-term expectations of full-time SWE work. After completing my project, I was set up to join Google full-time.
- **New grad SWE, Ads (2021):** I began as a remote new grad in the Bay Area, rejoining my intern team. My familiarity with the tech stack gave me a head start, allowing me to make immediate contributions. After a year, I sought new experiences, transitioning to Google Assistant to pursue my interests in machine learning and natural language processing.
- **Assistant NLP (2022):** My new team’s heavy in-person presence helped me meet many talented and passionate colleagues. As a new member among experienced engineers, I gradually integrated into projects and earned my first promotion. When LLMs began gaining traction with the introduction of ChatGPT, our team faced uncertainty as newer technologies emerged.
- **Bard/Gemini (2023):** Around Thanksgiving, leadership reorganized my team into Bard (now known as Gemini), a later part of Google DeepMind (which I refer to here as GDM). Everyone was new, and the environment was fast-paced as we took on an ambitious mission. The rapid growth brought opportunities for ownership, collaboration, and recognition. I was honored to work on this critical launch with such a dedicated team.

## [2] General commentary

Here, I'll outline some of the pros and cons of working at Google and GDM. These are all fairly common praises and critiques widely available on the Internet. Again, this is my personal take on the ones that stood out the most. Also, the benefits are self-explanatory, so I've put more focus on the downsides.

### The good
- **The people:** As the saying goes, the people make the place. I've met some of the most intelligent, hardworking, and passionate individuals in the field thanks to my time at Google + GDM. It's inspiring to see some of the brightest minds from around the world come together in one place, unified by a shared mission to advance technology and society. Saying goodbye to so many wonderful mentors, colleagues, and friends was undoubtedly one of the most challenging things I had ever done.
- **The impact:** Google serves billions of users daily across all its products and services. It's arguably one of the most impactful companies in the world. As a single engineer, a single line of code you write (*or fail to write*) can affect millions of individuals within the span of seconds. Even a simple experiment on a trivial feature can reach so many users worldwide. Though you may view yourself as insignificant when surrounded by a bunch of peers working on similar tasks, the level of impact you make at Google is really something special.
- **The perks:** The famous microkitchens, commuter shuttles, diverse cafés, and many other perks have given Google the "best company to work for" title many times across a wide range of sources. There's no doubt that Google goes the extra mile to treat its employees well. Google is also largely credited with setting these high standards of well-being across the broader tech industry, defining the industry's laid-back culture.


### The bad
- **Stagnation:** After 20 years since its founding in the *garage*, Google has grown into a corporate giant of nearly 200k employees. It naturally follows that the intense innovation and passion present in its early days would erode over time. There are now so many legacy teams stuck in maintenance mode, with no room for growth. This stagnation was more acceptable 5 years ago in the prime tech economy, where employees could work 2 hours a day and collect a cushy paycheck—*rest and vest*, as they call it. Now, those same teams are facing layoff after layoff, with the constant looming threat of being replaced or rendered obsolete. Advancement beyond L4/L5 has become exceedingly rare, and if one expects to peak in their career 2 years after graduating from college, what's the point of even trying? Note that this is more of a main-Google critique; things improved significantly after moving to GDM.
- **The bubble:** Yet another inevitable consequence of its size, Google feels like a separate bubble from the rest of the industry. The tech stack is incredibly siloed. Engineers spend valuable time onboarding to Google's internal processes/tools that aren't generally portable in the broader tech market. Even at GDM, we had our own specialized way of doing things, and I would always feel out of the loop with the wider AI community—*though perhaps research is different*. In my position, I never felt like I truly understood *AI*; I was just overfitting myself to Google's arbitrary protocol for optimizing various metrics in Assistant/Bard/Gemini. Keeping up to date with the field required a lot of *homework* outside my actual job, which was especially hard to carve out time for during my time on Gemini.
- **The bureaucracy:** I've had up to 8 managers in my reporting chain at once during my time at Google. With so many different levels, communication becomes considerably difficult. Due to many conflicting interests on priorities, projects would constantly be moved around, deprioritized, or tossed entirely, wasting thousands of precious eng-hours. ICs become completely misaligned with leadership, and it takes forever to make a simple decision since there are so many different people/teams to get approval from. In addition, many teams end up working on something similar due to miscommunication, and politics take over when determining who takes the prize. Fighting for scope and *playing the game* become more important than doing the actual work. It's basically the opposite of efficiency and just *getting stuff done*—virtues one would expect in a startup.
- **Comp:** I've never been the one to fixate on TC; my goal was always to make enough to live comfortably while working on something I found interesting. However, it's quite a common complaint that Google's comp packages are severely lacking compared to those of its competitors, both in the general SWE and AI markets. The discrepancy was fine a few years ago, when many saw the big G as just some comfy job with cushy perks and benefits; Google clearly got away with it because of its legacy and name brand. But now, in this climate? Especially in AI, with all the exorbitant packages to poach talent, I don't think Google can afford to be slacking anymore. Retention has become a greater issue lately, with top performers leaving at a rapid rate. If Google wants to both retain and attract new talent to remain competitive, it really needs to do better.
- **The AI race:** This is more of a broader industry complaint, but because it has accordingly impacted Gemini/GDM, I've included it. While leadership would always preach *work-life balance* to us, looming deadlines and constant competitor launches meant we could never truly relax. We had to be *on* all the time—our commute home, weekend outings, dinner with family, and so on. I was always thinking about work, unable to shut my brain off, and the barrage of work-related pings persisted through the night. No one explicitly demanded a *996*, but it was the natural state we found ourselves in under all the pressure. Don't get me wrong; I love sprinting and have relied on many short bursts of high-intensity work to get things done in my life. But *this* sprint never ended. Something out of our control would delay our launch, or we'd launch only to face an unexpected fire, or another project would become *P0000+* and require us to shift our focus completely.  Sprinting is all good and well, but it's called a *sprint*, meaning it's supposed to *end* eventually, right?

## [3] Why I left

TLDR: It was a combination of general burnout coupled with some significant life changes, realizations, and shifting priorities. My team at GDM has always been supportive, but I felt like I couldn't give them my best anymore. Coasting didn't seem *morally* right, and I couldn't muster the energy to switch teams or companies. I wanted to take some time off entirely from the AI/tech world and live on my own terms for a bit.

### Life changes
- **Marriage:** My husband and I got married in the summer of 2024. Previously, I didn't think marriage would change much about our lives, as we had been together since our first year of college. In fact, I had spent my entire time on Bard/Gemini being engaged and trying to plan our wedding, taking pride in my busyness, productivity, and self-perceived ability to *have it all*. If I could get all this done *during* the pre-wedding festivities, imagine how productive I'll be *after*? But then the day passed, and our lives/my mindset somewhat shifted. I've come to realize that the optimization function for a legally joined couple is vastly different from that for a single individual; I'll go into this later.
- **Health:** Around that time, I also had a thought: *maybe I should get a health checkup, since I'm in my mid-twenties now*. So I went to the doctor and did a lab panel, and EVERYTHING was red. Okay, a bit of an exaggeration, but I was shocked. My tests showed I had high cholesterol levels, glucose levels corresponding to prediabetes, and a severe vitamin D deficiency. My naive self previously thought that since I was relatively thin and had no glaring issues, I didn't need to take anything too seriously. I had become complacent with a sedentary lifestyle (*only getting activity on the weekends*) and a poor diet (*I consumed TONS of sugar, eating pastries for breakfast, and relying on many snacks at work to provide energy during intense workloads*). I had always taken my health for granted before, and this was a huge reality check.

### Mental bandwidth
With so many things going on at once and my team ceaselessly growing in size and complexity, it just became so strenuous to keep up. I naturally put my job first, and it ended up consuming me mentally. I woke up, thought about all my work obligations, responded to pings, and rushed between meetings. I'd be pushing the grocery cart at the supermarket with all the upcoming deadlines present in the back of my head. I'd lie in bed, and different variations of our model prompt would appear in my head just as I was about to nod off, jerking me awake. It was like *the grind* took over my brain, and I didn't know how to shut it off.

While I had been busy at various points in my life, such as high school or college, this time was *different*, and I attribute it to 3 reasons. First, being in school meant exposure to a broader range of subjects, such as the humanities and arts, rather than purely technical ones. Having this balance meant my brain wasn't confined to a single realm and could rest in between. Second, I had limited responsibilities other than academic achievement. During high school, my parents cooked all the meals and kept the house clean, and in college, our dorms and dining halls provided everything we needed to keep our undivided focus on school. As an adult, I became responsible for the basic upkeep of my life that I had previously taken for granted. Lastly, as mentioned before, I have to *actively* work on my health now. Plus, the mere fact that I am older now makes it harder to do the deep technical work that I handled so effortlessly in my teens. I had to be operating under optimal circumstances (*8 hours of sleep, peak energy levels, etc.*) to perform anything technically complex.

I also noticed my literary capabilities declining. The only time I ever read or wrote anything was coding or prompting. My vocabulary was diminishing as I struggled to recall words I had used before. My spoken language appeared choppy and unsophisticated. I noticed this and tried to get back into reading, but it had become so arduous for my brain to process actual literary text that wasn't code or a prompt. It felt like I had *become* a robot/computer, rather than just *training* them —living and breathing in binary.

### A macroeconomics lesson
Back in school, I took an introductory economics class and learned about the concept of absolute advantage vs. comparative advantage. Simply put, absolute advantage measures a nation's efficiency in producing a good relative to another good, and comparative advantage measures the nation's production of the two goods relative to the production ratios of another nation. To determine whether trade is economically advantageous between the two, we look at comparative rather than absolute advantage.

The macroeconomic claim felt counterintuitive, but simple mathematics supported it. And if it's verified for international policy, could a parallel be drawn inside marriages? Since childhood, I have focused on optimizing *myself* as a single unit. I was academically gifted, especially in math and science. Thus, I naturally gravitated towards a technical career and focused most of my attention on my academic and professional accomplishments. However, after marriage, I no longer viewed my life as an optimization objective for a single individual, but rather a holistic unit of two. My husband, who is an AI researcher, also had a demanding job and was arguably more technically proficient and capable of handling intense workloads. At the same time, though I prided myself on being career-driven, I was clearly better (*and naturally took on most of the load*) at preparing meals, keeping our space clean, and managing general household responsibilities.

As a result, I thought we could experiment with *specialization* to maximize efficiency in our lives—*at least for a while*. This simplified model seemed to have the potential to enable me to be more productive in a compromised state, *given these economic principles*, while minimizing the overhead cost of task/context switching. Consequently, my husband took on the financial responsibility, and I handled everything else—cooking healthy meals, maintaining our home, managing our shared schedule, etc. So far, I'd say this experiment has gone quite well and has produced measurable improvements for both of us. In terms of quantifiables, we have consumed more nutritious, homemade meals, have more time to exercise and spend time together, and our stress levels have gone down significantly. Additionally, by not having to worry about anything at home and therefore being able to redirect that extra focus to work, my husband has been able to accelerate his career, which has entirely made up for — *and even surpassed* — the initial loss of my income.

So is this it? Is this how couples should operate: *man hard at work, woman confined to the home*? Not necessarily, so don't come at me for putting out *anti-feminist propaganda*. Obviously, every couple is different, each individual has varying goals/interests, and there's more to life than optimizing efficiency. This setup is just what has worked for us *in the moment*. I will say, though, it's been quite convenient for my husband to advance his career faster and for me to focus on my health, which is especially critical if I want kids in the future—*a harsh reality of being a woman*.

### Life outside tech
Another motivation was to expand my horizons beyond tech/AI after being siloed in the industry for so long. Especially with a husband working at the forefront of AI, I sought to diversify myself and our shared life. Even if I eventually went back, I knew it was essential to step back to achieve a more balanced perspective. I decided to use this time to enjoy all the things I wanted to do but had never had the time or energy for before, as described in the next section.

## [4] What's next?

Currently, I've been focusing on health, household responsibilities, and simply trying to live a well-rounded life without too much structure. In a society so tied to the concept of *occupation*, I don't have clear answers about my next *career move* at the moment. Because of this, I was hesitant to add this section, but I'll cover more on what I've done so far and my vision for the future.


### What I've done
- **Prioritizing my health:** Self-explanatory, so I'll keep it short. Health is my utmost priority, and it falls into three categories: exercise, diet, and sleep. I've been maintaining a somewhat consistent weekly [schedule](/fitness.html) of runs/hikes/gym time, have done my fair share of research and experimentation on nutrition optimization (*in addition to the manual labor of meal prep—see [cookbook](/cookbook.html)*), and am broadly trying to get enough rest. I'm planning to make a separate post about all of this as well, so stay tuned.
- **Exploring other interests:** When I first left my job, all I wanted to do was work with my hands *rather than use my brain intensively*. I wanted to try something new and different, and get my mind off of AI/tech entirely. I began taking a few ceramics classes at a local studio and started volunteering at our local nonprofit community garden and cat shelter. I've also started collecting and growing my own [plants](/plants.html), and adopted two [kittens](/kitties.html) after fostering an entire litter. It's been eye-opening to explore different domains, and I find life much more enriching now.
- **Embracing stochasticity:** I also set out to simply live—*at least for a period of time*—without artificial deadlines or rigid structure. Instead of enforcing a strict schedule/timeline, I try to listen to myself and just do what *feels* right, day by day. I've always been an extremely Type A person, and this was very unsettling at first, but after some time, I've begun to really appreciate this way of living! I’m not claiming I won't default back to a more organized/demanding lifestyle in the future; I'm just trying to enjoy the present.

### My future goals
- **Achieving green metrics:** Referencing the Google standard, if I make my health a top *OKR*, there must be *deliverables*. While fitness goals are subjective, I want to achieve an all-green health panel—no abnormal results in *any* category (*thankfully, prediabetes and high cholesterol are fully reversible*)—before starting anything new in my life. As told on Gemini, *the dashboard needs to be all green before we launch*!
- **Solidifying habits:** It takes an average of 66 days to form a habit, according to *Atomic Habits*. While I'm not a fan of self-help books, this is a commonly cited statistic, and it makes sense. In addition to simply *obtaining* a healthy panel, I'd like for my current routine to *fully materialize* before settling into the next chapter of my life. I'm proud of the progress I've made so far, and the last thing I would want is for everything to go down the drain as soon as I move onto the *next big thing*. Besides, I'm still experimenting with different methods and mechanisms, so it might take more time to find and establish an optimal routine that *truly* works the best.
- **Finding something sustainable:** After all is said and done, I see two distinct, conventional paths ahead of me: [1] *go back to tech/AI*, or [2] *remain in the domestic sphere and start having/raising kids*. Of course, there are also *career pivots, lateral moves, side hustles, etc.*, that I can explore. Right now, I'm not sure where I'll land next. I want to remain in the professional world in some capacity, as it would add another dimension to my life. I don't view having kids as an excuse to get out of it; if anything, it's a reason to *stay* professionally involved so I’m not siloed or deeply confined to a single objective, as I was at my previous job—the prime recipe for burnout. At the same time, I need to find something *sustainable*, health- and time-wise. I currently want a break from anything technically complex, but I still want to make use of the degree I worked so hard for. Anyway, aside from the rambling, I'm not putting too much pressure on myself right now to figure this all out. I've generally found that rushed plans are far from ideal.

In conclusion, the future is uncertain, but that’s what makes it exciting, especially when I thought I had my life perfectly planned out before. I'm looking forward to whatever comes next, and am grateful for everything I got to experience throughout my time at Google, GDM, and the broader tech/AI industry. As the saying goes, *when nothing is sure, everything is possible*.
