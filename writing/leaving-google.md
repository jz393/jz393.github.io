Hi, I'm Jane. I worked at [Google](https://about.google/) and [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) for 4 years as a software engineer/machine learning engineer on [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/). Before that, I completed two summer internships in Ads and Cloud during my time at [Cornell](https://www.cornell.edu). This past summer, I decided to leave Alphabet, and I will elaborate more on my experience and motivations here.

I'm aware there are numerous *Why I Left Google* perspectives out there already. I'm not aiming for mine to be exceptionally unique among the rest; I'm just organizing my personal thoughts. It contains 4 sections: **[1] my personal background**, **[2] general commentary** on the pros/cons of Google and DeepMind, **[3] why I left**, and **[4] what's next**. Feel free to skip around, as there is *a lot* of content. Also, thanks to Deedy's [post](https://debarghyadas.com/writes/why-i-left-google/) for structural inspiration.


## [1] My time at Google

I want to preface this by saying Google has been integral to both my college experience and young adult life. It was immensely difficult to say goodbye to something I had considered as a core part of both my professional and personal identity. After all, it had been my dream company ever since I started studying computer science.

### Background and timeline
- **The interview (2018):** A recruiter reached out to me and invited me to an interview! It was quite the busy semester as a college sophomore, and I was totally caught off guard. Fortunately, I had practiced some Leetcode problems throughout the summer. My interview was online, on a Google Doc. I got two questions; the first was an easy string manipulation one that I quickly solved. The second was trying to simulate some scenario that could be described by a series of finite states, and I had no idea how to translate it into code. I was super defeated, but 10 minutes before the end, I suddenly remembered the term *DFA—deterministic finite automaton*, which I had learned in my discrete math class the semester prior. I scrambled to convert the DFA into code in the last few minutes, typing barely legible pseudocode and blurting out thoughts that seemed incomprehensible. After the time was up, I thought I had definitely failed. A week later, my recruiter randomly calls me out of the blue. I missed the call and called back as soon as I saw it, but he had already gone home for the day. As expected, I couldn't focus on anything else, but we eventually found some time to chat the next day. I nervously take the call between classes, and he tells me I've been offered the job. Wow, I can't believe it; I got into my dream company!!! In the following months, I participated in team matching and brushed up on C++ / various machine learning concepts to prepare for my internship.
- **First internship, Cloud (2019):** I was so excited to begin my journey at Google and live in SF for the first time! I got a high-rise apartment with a few other interns, and we would take the MUNI to the SF office together. Orientation was in the MTV headquarters, and everything was so cool. With all the free swag, colorful bikes, and seemingly endless array of cafés sprawled across campus, we were living the dream. When it was time to actually integrate with my team and submit code, I was quite intimidated. I couldn't even get anything to compile at first. Thankfully, my host was extremely patient, and I realized it was just some syntax errors and the latency of the internal code editor. With the support of my host and team, I was able to finish my project ahead of schedule, complete some additional tasks, and learn a great deal about the team and company dynamics. Outside of work, there were so many fun intern events and endless things to do in the city.
- **Second internship, Ads (2020):** At this point, COVID had taken over, so my internship was made remote—*unfortunate but better than getting cancelled entirely*.  I had a laptop and monitor shipped to Ithaca and set up a remote office in my student apartment. Without the in-person presence and the extravagant intern events, things seemed much more serious than the summer before. I programmed a basic application—both the front and back ends—in the team codebase and got a sense of what full-stack SWE was actually like (*compared to the summer before, when I had worked on a relatively self-contained intern project*). I also began to conceptualize what being a full-time SWE entails: promotions, politics, scope, etc. It wasn't just carelessly hacking all day. Anyway, I finished my project and submitted a bunch of code, so everything was set for me to join full-time.
- **New grad SWE, Ads (2021):** COVID was still a thing, so I started remote again, but this time in the Bay Area. I joined my previous intern team, and everything was relatively stable. Because I was already familiar with the tech stack, I was able to jump in and contribute immediately. This went on for around a year, until ~May 2022, when Google announced RTO. However, most of my team remained remote. I liked my team but wanted to try something else—something with a more in-person, collaborative presence and closer to my interest in machine learning/natural language processing (*compared to general SWE*). Thus, I began the transition into my next team, Assistant NLP.
- **Assistant NLP (2022):** This is when things started *happening*! My new team had a heavy in-person presence, and I met so many new people. Everyone seemed so brilliant and passionate about what they were doing. There weren't many L3s, as the team leaned more towards experienced/specialized folks, so I felt a bit out of place as an early-career SWE. Nevertheless, I gradually began integrating into more projects and eventually landed my first promotion. At the same time, ChatGPT had just come out, and LLMs were now a thing. Google Assistant wasn't so hot anymore, and it no longer felt safe in the team. We were quickly getting replaced by more advanced technologies, and many of us were scrambling towards an out...
- **Bard/Gemini (2023):** Thankfully, around Thanksgiving 2023, my team was reorganized into Bard (*now known as Gemini*), which later became incorporated into Google DeepMind (*which I refer to here as GDM*). I suddenly had a new team. Everyone was new, actually, and it was the first time Google was building something like this. It was the ultimate race to catch up, so we dove in headfirst. Daily standups, lightning speed, limited corporate oversight - it was such an exciting time! It was easy to define ownership areas and carve out exciting, impactful projects because everything was so new. The team expanded quickly, and we enjoyed countless events, celebrations, and gifts in recognition of all the hard work on this critical launch. I was so honored to contribute to such an important mission alongside numerous devoted engineers and researchers.

## [2] General commentary

Here I'll outline some of the pros and cons of working at Google and GDM. I think these are all fairly common praises and critiques that have already been widely shared across the Internet. Again, this is just my personal take on the ones that stood out the most. Also, I think the benefits are quite self-explanatory, so I've put more focus on the downsides.

### The good
- **The people:** As the saying goes, the people make the place. I've met some of the most intelligent, hardworking, and passionate individuals in the field thanks to my time at Google + GDM. It's inspiring to see some of the brightest minds from around the world come together in one place, unified by a shared mission to advance technology and society. Saying goodbye to so many wonderful mentors, colleagues, and friends was undoubtedly one of the most difficult things I had ever done.
- **The impact:** Google serves billions of users daily across all its products and services. It's arguably one of the most impactful companies in the world. As a single engineer, a single line of code you write (*or fail to write*) can affect millions of individuals within the span of seconds. Even a simple experiment on a trivial feature can reach so many users worldwide. Though you may view yourself as insignificant when surrounded by a bunch of peers working on similar tasks, the level of impact you make at Google is really something special.
- **The perks:** The famous microkitchens, commuter shuttles, diverse cafés, and many other perks have given Google the "best company to work for" title many times across a wide range of sources. There's no doubt that Google goes the extra mile to treat its employees well. Google is also largely credited with setting these high standards of well-being across the wider tech industry, defining the industry's laid-back culture.


### The bad
- **Stagnation:** After 20 years since its founding in the *garage*, Google has grown into a corporate giant of nearly 200k employees. It naturally follows that the intense innovation and passion present in its early days would erode over time. There are now so many legacy teams stuck in maintenance mode, with no room for growth. This was more acceptable 5 years ago in the prime tech economy, where employees could work 2 hours a day and collect a cushy paycheck—*rest and vest*, as they call it. Now, those same teams are facing layoff after layoff, with the constant looming threat of being replaced or rendered obsolete. Advancement beyond L4/L5 has become exceedingly rare, and if one is expected to reach the peak of their career 2 years after graduating from college, what's the point of even trying? Note that this is more of a main-Google critique; things improved significantly after moving to GDM.
- **The bubble:** Yet another inevitable consequence of its size, Google feels like a separate bubble from the rest of the industry. The tech stack is incredibly siloed. Engineers spend valuable time onboarding to Google's internal processes/tools that aren't generally portable in the broader tech market. Even at GDM, we had our own specialized way of doing things, and I would always feel out of the loop with the broader AI community—*though perhaps research is different*. In my position, I never felt like I truly understood *AI*; I was just overfitting myself to Google's arbitrary protocol for optimizing various metrics in Assistant/Bard/Gemini. Keeping up to date with the field required a lot of *homework* outside my actual job, which was especially hard to carve out time for during my time on Gemini.
- **The bureaucracy:** I've had up to 8 managers in my reporting chain at once during my time at Google. With so many different levels, communication becomes considerably difficult. Due to many conflicting interests on priorities, projects would constantly be moved around/deprioritized/tossed entirely, wasting thousands of precious eng-hours. ICs become completely misaligned with leadership, and it takes forever to make a simple decision since there are so many different people/teams to get approval from. In addition, many different teams end up working on something similar due to miscommunication, and politics take over when determining who takes the prize. Fighting for scope and *playing the game* become more important than doing the actual work. It's basically the opposite of efficiency and just *getting stuff done*—virtues one would expect in a startup.
- **Comp:** Honestly, I've never been the one to fixate on TC. My goal was always to make enough to live comfortably while working on something I found interesting. However, it's quite a common complaint that Google's comp packages are severely lacking compared to those of its competitors, both in the general SWE and AI markets. I think this was fine a few years ago, when many saw the big G as just some comfy job with cushy perks and benefits; Google clearly got away with it because of its legacy and name brand. But now, in this climate? Especially in AI, with all the exorbitant packages to poach talent, I don't think Google can afford to be slacking anymore. Retention has become a greater issue lately, with top performers leaving at a rapid rate. If Google wants to both retain and attract new talent to remain competitive, it really needs to do better.
- **The AI race:** This is more of a broader industry complaint, but because it has accordingly impacted Gemini/GDM, I've included it. While leadership would always preach *work-life balance* to us, looming deadlines and constant competitor launches meant we could never truly relax. We had to be *on* all the time—our commute home, weekend outings, dinner with family, and so on. I was always thinking about work, unable to shut my brain off, and the barrage of work-related pings persisted through the night. No one explicitly demanded a *996*, but it was the natural state we found ourselves in under all the pressure. Don't get me wrong; I love sprinting, and have relied on many short bursts of high-intensity work to get things done in my life. But *this* sprint never ended. The launch would be delayed by something out of our control, or we'd launch only to face an unexpected fire, or another project would become *P0000+* and require us to completely shift our focus.  Sprinting is all good and well, but it's called a *sprint*, meaning it's supposed to come to an end eventually, right?

## [3] Why I left

TLDR: It was a combination of general burnout coupled with some major life changes, realizations, and shifting priorities. My team at GDM has always been supportive, but I felt like I couldn't give them my best anymore. Coasting didn't seem *morally* right, and I couldn't muster the energy to switch teams or companies. I just wanted to take some time off entirely from the AI/tech world and live on my own terms for a bit.

### Life changes
- **Marriage:** My husband and I got married in the summer of 2024. Previously, I didn't think marriage would change much about our lives, as we had been together since our freshman year of college. In fact, I had spent my entire time on Bard/Gemini being engaged and trying to plan our wedding, taking pride in my busyness, productivity, and self-perceived ability to *have it all*. If I could get all this done *during* the pre-wedding festivities, imagine how productive I'll be *after*? But then the day passed, and our lives/my mindset somewhat shifted. I've come to realize that the optimization function for a legally joined couple is vastly different from that for a single individual; I'll go into this later.
- **Health:** Around that time, I also had a thought: *maybe I should get a health checkup, since I'm in my mid-twenties now*. So I went to the doctor and did a lab panel, and EVERYTHING was red. Okay, a bit of an exaggeration, but I was shocked. My tests showed I had high cholesterol levels, glucose levels corresponding to prediabetes, and a severe vitamin D deficiency. My naive self previously thought that since I was relatively thin and had no glaring issues, I didn't need to take anything too seriously. I had become complacent with a sedentary lifestyle (*only getting activity on the weekends*) and a poor diet (*I consumed TONS of sugar, eating pastries for breakfast, and relying on many snacks at work to provide energy during intense workloads*). I had always taken my health for granted before, and this was a huge reality check.

### Mental bandwidth
With so many things going on at once and my team ceaselessly growing in size and complexity, it just became so strenuous to keep up. I naturally put my job first, and it ended up consuming me mentally. I woke up, thought about all my work obligations, responded to pings, and rushed between meetings. I'd be pushing the grocery cart at the supermarket with all the upcoming deadlines present in the back of my head. I'd lie in bed, and different variations of our model prompt would appear in my head just as I was about to nod off, jerking me awake. It was like *the grind* took over my brain, and I didn't know how to shut it off.

While I had been busy at various points in my life, such as high school or college, this time was *different*, and I attribute it to 3 reasons. First, being in school meant exposure to a broader range of subjects, such as the humanities and arts, rather than purely technical ones. Having this balance meant my brain wasn't confined to a single realm and could rest in between. Second, I had limited responsibilities other than academic achievement. During high school, my parents cooked all the meals and kept the house clean, and in college, our dorms and dining halls provided everything we needed to keep our undivided focus on school. As an adult, I became responsible for the basic upkeep of my life that I had previously taken for granted. Lastly, as mentioned before, health is something I have to actively work for now. Plus, the mere fact that I am older now makes it harder to do the deep technical work that I handled so effortlessly in my teens. I felt that I had to be operating under optimal circumstances (*8 hours of sleep, peak energy levels, etc.*) to perform anything technically complex.

I also noticed my literary capabilities declining. The only time I ever read or wrote anything was coding or prompting. My vocabulary was diminishing as I struggled to recall words I had used before. My spoken language appeared choppy and unsophisticated. I noticed this and tried to get back into reading, but it had become so arduous for my brain to process actual literary text that wasn't code or a prompt. I felt as if I had actually become a robot/computer, *rather than just training them*, living and breathing in binary.

### A macroeconomics lesson
Back in school, I took a basic economics class and learned about the concept of absolute advantage vs. comparative advantage. Simply put, absolute advantage measures a nation's efficiency in producing a good relative to another good, and comparative advantage measures the nation's production of the two goods relative to the production ratios of another nation. To determine whether trade is economically advantageous between the two, we look at comparative rather than absolute advantage.

To me, this concept was quite unintuitive, but it was backed by simple mathematics. And if it's verified for international policy, could a parallel be drawn inside marriages? Since childhood, I have focused on optimizing *myself* as a single unit. I was academically gifted, especially in math and science. Thus, I naturally gravitated towards a technical career and focused most of my attention on my academic and professional accomplishments. However, after marriage, I no longer viewed my life as an optimization objective for a single individual, but rather a holistic unit of two. My husband, who is an AI researcher, also had a demanding job and was arguably more technically proficient and capable of handling intense workloads. At the same time, though I prided myself on being career-driven, I was clearly better (*and naturally took on most of the load*) at preparing meals, keeping our space clean, and managing general household responsibilities.

As a result, I thought we could experiment with *specialization* to maximize efficiency in our lives—*at least for a while*. This simplified model seemed to have the potential to enable me to be more productive in a compromised state, *given these macroeconomic principles*, while minimizing the overhead cost of task/context switching. Consequently, my husband took on the financial responsibility, and I handled everything else—cooking healthy meals, maintaining our home, managing our shared schedule, etc. So far, I'd say this experiment has gone quite well and has produced measurable improvements for both of us. In terms of quantifiables, we have consumed more nutritious, homemade meals, have more time to exercise and spend time together, and our stress levels have gone down significantly. Additionally, by not having to worry about anything at home and therefore being able to redirect that extra focus to work, my husband has been able to accelerate his career, which has completely made up for — *and even surpassed* — the initial loss of my income.

So is this it? Is this how couples should operate: *man hard at work, woman confined to the home*? Not necessarily, so don't come at me for putting out *anti-feminist propaganda*. Obviously, every couple is different, each individual has varying goals/interests, and there's more to life than optimizing efficiency. This is just what worked for us *in the moment*. I will say, though, it's been quite convenient for my husband to advance his career faster and for me to focus on my health, which is especially critical if I want kids in the future—*a harsh reality of being a woman*.

### Life outside tech
Another motivation was to expand my horizons beyond tech/AI after being siloed in the industry for so long. Especially with a husband working at the forefront of AI, I sought to diversify myself and our shared life. Even if I eventually went back, I knew it was important to step back to achieve a more balanced perspective. I decided to use this time to enjoy all the things I wanted to do but had never had the time or energy for before, as described in the next section.

## [4] What's next?

So far, I've been focusing on health, household responsibilities, and simply trying to live a well-rounded life without too much structure. In a society where we are so tied to our occupations, I don't have clear answers about my next career move at the moment. Because of this, I was hesitant to add this section, but I'll cover more on what I've done so far and my vision for the future.


### What I've done
- **Prioritizing my health:** Self-explanatory, so I'll keep it short. Health is my utmost priority and is typically broken down into 3 categories: exercise, diet, and sleep. I've been maintaining a somewhat consistent weekly [schedule](/fitness.html) of runs/hikes/gym time, have done my fair share of research and experimentation on nutrition optimization (*in addition to the manual labor of meal prep—see [cookbook](/cookbook.html)*), and am broadly trying to get enough rest. I'm planning to make a separate post about all of this as well, so stay tuned.
- **Exploring other interests:** When I first left my job, all I wanted to do was work with my hands *rather than use my brain intensively*. I wanted to try something new and different, and get my mind off of AI/tech entirely. I began taking a few ceramics classes at a local studio and started volunteering at our local nonprofit community garden and cat shelter. I've also started collecting and growing my own [plants](/plants.html), and adopted two [kittens](/kitties.html) after fostering an entire litter. It's been so nice getting to explore different domains, and I find life a lot more enriching now.
- **Embracing stochasticity:** I also set out to simply live, *at least for a period of time*, without artificial deadlines or rigid structure. Instead of enforcing a strict schedule/timeline, I try to listen to myself and just do what *feels* right, day by day. I've always been an extremely Type A person, and this was very unsettling at first, but after some time, I've begun to really appreciate this way of living! This isn't to say that I won't default back to a more organized/demanding lifestyle in the future; I'm just trying to enjoy the present *right now*.

### My future goals
- **Achieving green metrics:** Referencing the Google standard, if I make my health a top *OKR*, there must be *deliverables*. While fitness goals are subjective, I want to achieve an all-green health panel—no abnormal results in *any* category (*thankfully, prediabetes and high cholesterol are fully reversible*)—before starting anything new in my life. As we were told on Gemini, *the dashboard needs to be all green before we launch*!
- **Solidifying habits:** It takes an average of 66 days to form a habit, according to *Atomic Habits*. While I'm not a fan of self-help books, this is a commonly cited statistic, and it makes sense. In addition to simply *obtaining* a healthy panel, I'd like for my current routine to be *fully grounded* before settling into the next chapter of my life. I'm proud of the progress I've made so far, and the last thing I would want is for everything to go down the drain as soon as I move onto the *next big thing*. Besides, I'm still experimenting with different methods and mechanisms, so it might take more time to find and establish an optimal routine that *truly* works the best.
- **Finding something sustainable:** After all is said and done, I see two distinct, conventional paths ahead of me: [1] *go back to tech/AI*, or [2] *remain in the domestic sphere and start having/raising kids*. Of course, there are also *career pivots, lateral moves, side hustles, etc.*, that I can explore. Right now, I'm not exactly sure where I'll land next. I think I'd still want to remain in the professional world in some capacity, as it would add another dimension to my life. I don't view having kids as an excuse to get out of it; if anything, it's a reason to *stay* professionally involved so I’m not siloed or deeply confined to a single objective, as I was at my previous job—the prime recipe for burnout. At the same time, I need to find something *sustainable*, health- and time-wise. I currently want a break from anything technically complex, but I still want to make use of the degree I worked so hard for. Anyway, aside from the rambling, I'm not putting too much pressure on myself right now to figure this all out. I've generally found that rushed plans are far from ideal.

In conclusion, the future is uncertain, but that’s what makes it exciting, especially when I thought I had my life perfectly planned out before. I'm looking forward to whatever comes next, and am grateful for everything I got to experience throughout my time at Google, GDM, and the broader tech/AI industry. As the saying goes, *when nothing is sure, everything is possible*.
