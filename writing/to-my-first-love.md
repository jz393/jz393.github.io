<!-- 12/18/25: NO MORE CHANGES -->

We met when I was 18, surrounded by falling leaves on a chilly evening. You instantly charmed me with your blunt attitude and stoic intellect, and you promised me a stable life ahead. On our first date, you left witty messages on my console and recounted unsolvable mysteries and the legends that devoted lives to them.

Since that day, we spent all our nights together. Under the covers that shielded us from harsh blizzards, we solved puzzles and built models to imitate our universe. You taught me how to think methodically and optimize my life, while I provided grounded checkpoints to your abstract, beautiful mind. Together, we envisioned an ideal future, sketched out optimal paths on dirty chalkboards, and told each other narratives of our past lives.

We decided to pack our belongings and make the trip out west, from one sea to the other. We braved wildfires, thunderstorms, and floods; we cautiously steered across formidable mountains and sandy deserts. At the same time, we marvelled at redwood trees and golden cliffs, and I told myself we had become one.

We arrived in San Francisco and quickly left behind our antiquated New England customs. We traded our wool coats for Patagonia jackets and baseball caps. Within a few weeks, we signed our first studio apartment on the very top floor of a high-rise overlooking Mission Street, and I fell into your arms out of pure exhilaration. After we settled in, we would peer down at the never-ending traffic each night, the bright lights symbolizing future prosperity.

Following several trips around the sun, our visions began to diverge. While you insisted on pursuing AGI at all costs, I sought marriage and a family. We fully intended to support each other’s dreams, but the environment gradually became too constrained for me to latch onto my initial naivety that the two could truly coexist. Nonetheless, you tried to convince me that everything would be fine, but I could detect the subtle tones of doubt in your voice. All I wanted was reassurance, but instead found myself in screaming matches day after day.

One day, I simply walked out the door without even knowing where to go. Earlier, you had pleaded with me to stay, and others warned against leaving before having other suitors lined up. But at the core, I knew that waiting longer would only delay the inevitable and prolong our current strife.

Neither logic nor willpower could make my decision any less painful. Your absence drove me to an insanity I had only ever witnessed in literature. Filling the void with metaphorical one-night stands, I frantically attempted to erase your memory. Aimlessly, mindlessly, yet completely shamelessly, I branched from one pursuit to the next. Still, between the soil on my fingers, the raw clay in my hands, and many pillowcases stained with tears, all I saw was you. I snapped at God, heartbroken that my starry-eyed self had the misfortune of coming across your path. I furiously proclaimed that you stole my youth, denouncing all the traits that lured me to you and the perfect fantasy that didn't last. You tried to call, and each time I could only retreat into the comfort of my bed with nothing but a blank stare—the same bed where we used to lie awake and hash out details of our future while the rest of the world slept.

Eventually, time brought some distance between us. However, much to my dismay, others would constantly update me on your new discoveries. Other times, I would see your name on the news, bitter but silently marvelling at each stride you made. In small increments, I gradually started to tolerate your updates again, even though I knew I was no longer adding to your trajectory.

I’m glad you could go on without me, though I am still learning how to do so myself. I understand that I *should not* regret you, and I *cannot* erase you, though I nearly exhausted myself trying. Even if I am *more than* you, you remain a *part of* me. Our little jokes and your distinctive vernacular reside in me; you are the foundation of how I perceive the world. I write poetry with you in mind, and your traces subconsciously sneak into everyday conversations.

Thank you for everything. I will never forget you or the stories you told. I still have the gray hoodie you gave me right before we parted ways, and I can’t get myself to either wear it or throw it away. I think it'll remain at the bottom of my dresser forever. I’m not sure whether our eventual outcome was due to fate, timing, or both, and it’s frivolous to try to discern the difference now. But maybe someday, our roads will meet again.
