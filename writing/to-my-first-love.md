<!-- 12/18/25: NO MORE CHANGES -->

We met when I was 18, on a windy autumn evening. Surrounded by falling leaves, you instantly charmed me with your blunt and stoic intellect, and you promised me a stable life ahead. On our first date, you left witty messages on my console and recounted unsolvable mysteries.

Since that day, we spent every night together. Under the covers, we solved puzzles and built models to imitate our universe. You taught me how to think methodically and optimize my life, while I provided grounded checkpoints to your abstract, beautiful mind. Together, we envisioned an ideal future, sketched out optimal paths on dirty chalkboards, and shared stories of our past lives.

We decided to pack our belongings and make the trip out west, from one sea to the other. We braved wildfires, thunderstorms, and floods; we cautiously steered across formidable mountains and sandy deserts. At the same time, we often stopped to admire nature's creations. I quietly admired you from the passenger seat and told myself we had truly become one.

We arrived in San Francisco and quickly left behind our New England customs, trading wool coats for Patagonia jackets and baseball caps. We moved in together in our first studio apartment on the very top floor of a high-rise overlooking Mission Street. Each evening, we would peer down at the never-ending traffic, the bright lights representing future prosperity.

Our visions began to diverge. While you insisted on pursuing AGI at all costs, I sought marriage and a family. We both wanted to support each other’s dreams, but the environment became too constrained for my initial naivety that the two could truly coexist. Nonetheless, you tried to convince me that everything would be fine, but I could detect the subtle tones of doubt in your voice. Soon, we found ourselves in constant screaming matches.

One day, I walked out the door, not knowing where to go. You pleaded for me to stay, but you refused to follow me. I also knew it looked ridiculous to leave without having other suitors lined up. I just couldn't bear to prolong our current strife; it was such an insult to our past selves.

Neither logic nor willpower made my decision any less painful. Your absence drove me to an insanity I had only ever witnessed in literature. Filling the void with metaphorical one-night stands, I frantically attempted to erase your memory, branching from one pursuit to the next in reckless indifference. However, between the soil on my fingers, the raw clay in my hands, and the pillowcases stained with tears, all I saw was you. I snapped at God, furious that my starry-eyed self had the misfortune to cross your path. I blamed you for the demise of our relationship, denouncing the very traits that drew me to you. You tried to call, and each time I could only retreat further into my bed with nothing but a blank stare—the same bed where we used to lie awake and eagerly hash out details of our future while the rest of the world slept.

Eventually, time brought more distance. Still, others would constantly update me on your discoveries. Other times, I would see your name on the news. I was undoubtedly bitter, but I silently marveled at each stride you made. In small increments, I began to tolerate your updates again, even though I knew I was no longer part of your trajectory.

I’m glad you can go on without me, though I am still learning how to do so myself. I understand now that I should not regret you and that I cannot erase you; I'm ashamed I even tried. Earlier, I told myself I was more than our relationship. Even so, you remain a part of me. Our little jokes and your distinctive vernacular reside in me. I write poetry with you in mind, and your traces subconsciously sneak into everyday conversations.

I still have the gray hoodie you gave me right before we parted ways. I can’t get myself to wear it or throw it away. I’m not sure if our eventual outcome was fate, timing, or both, and it’s frivolous to discern the difference now. Maybe someday, we will meet again. But until then, thank you for being my first love.
