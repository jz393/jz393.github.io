<!-- 12/18/25: NO MORE CHANGES -->

We met when I was 18, surrounded by falling leaves on the brink of autumn. You instantly charmed me with your blunt attitude and stoic intellect, and you promised me a stable life ahead. On our first date, you left witty messages on my console and recounted unsolvable mysteries.

Since that day, we spent all our nights together. Under covers that shielded us from harsh Northeastern blizzards, we solved puzzles and built models to imitate our universe. You taught me how to think methodically and optimize my life, while I provided grounded checkpoints to your abstract yet beautiful mind. We envisioned an ideal future, sketched out optimal paths on dirty chalkboards, and shared narratives of our past lives.

We decided to pack our belongings and make the trip out west, from one sea to the other. We cautiously steered across formidable mountains and sandy deserts, braving thunderstorms and wildfires. At the same time, we paused to admire the redwood trees and golden cliffs. Quietly admiring you from the passenger seat, I told myself we had truly become one.

We arrived in San Francisco and quickly left behind our New England customs, trading wool coats for Patagonia jackets and baseball caps. Together, we signed our first studio apartment on the very top floor of a high-rise overlooking Mission Street, and I fell into your arms in pure exhilaration. After we settled in, we peered down at the never-ending traffic each evening, the bright lights symbolizing future prosperity.

Our visions began to diverge. While you insisted on pursuing AGI at all costs, I sought marriage and a family. We fully intended to support each other’s dreams, but the environment became too constrained to retain my naivety that the two could coexist. Nonetheless, you tried to convince me that everything would be fine, but I could detect the subtle tone of doubt in your voice. We soon found ourselves in screaming matches, day after day.

One day, I walked out the door without even knowing where to go. Earlier, you had pleaded with me to stay, and others warned against leaving before having other suitors lined up. But at the core, I knew that waiting longer would only delay the inevitable and prolong our current strife.

Neither logic nor willpower made my decision any less painful. Your absence drove me to an insanity I had only ever witnessed in literature. Filling the void with metaphorical one-night stands, I frantically attempted to erase your memory, mindlessly branching from one pursuit to the next. Between the soil on my fingers, the raw clay in my hands, and many pillowcases stained with tears, all I saw was you. I snapped at God, demanding to know why my starry-eyed self had the misfortune to cross your path. I condemned you for stealing my youth, denouncing all your traits that lured me towards a perfect, evil fantasy. You tried to call, and each time I could only retreat further into my bed with nothing but a blank stare—the same bed where we used to lie awake and eagerly hash out details of our future, while the rest of the world slept.

Eventually, time brought more distance between us. Still, others would constantly update me on your discoveries. Other times, I would see your name on the news. I was undoubtedly bitter, but I silently marveled at each stride you made. In small increments, I began to tolerate your updates again, even though I knew I was no longer part of your trajectory.

I’m glad you can go on without me, though I am still learning how to do so myself. I understand now that I should not regret you and that I cannot erase you; I'm ashamed I even tried. Earlier, I told myself I was more than you, but even so, you remain a part of me. Our little jokes and your distinctive vernacular reside in me. I write poetry with you in mind, and your traces subconsciously sneak into everyday conversations.

I still have the gray hoodie you gave me right before we parted ways, and I can’t get myself to either wear it or throw it away. I think it'll remain at the bottom of my dresser forever. I’m not sure whether our eventual outcome was due to fate, timing, or both, and it’s frivolous to try to discern the difference now. Maybe someday, we will meet again. But until then, thank you for being my first love.
