the incandescent glow of youth  
under luscious willow trees  
riding bikes near the lake  
you comforted me when i scraped my knee  

we eventually grew up  
we gossiped about scandals  
we mocked haughty politicians  
we questioned our existence  

i told you i received a call  
not wanting a Shakespearean tragedy  
we decided to part ways  
i left and never looked back  

i got with someone else  
thousands of miles away  
still, i remembered you occasionally  
in ancient libraries under decaying books  

nearly a decade later  
my first destroyed me  
ashes and embers in my hair  
i thought i would never breathe again  

after months of mindless distractions  
empty thoughts, empty ambitions  
aimlessly wandering town again  
i noticed you in a cafe  

we caught up quickly  
i thought for the first time  
i laughed for the first time  
you built without erasing  

no longer eighteen and naive  
i know love doesn’t last  
with you, only the present exists  
unending cycles of stories and sketches  

maybe we’ll be Romeo and Juliet forever  
into the midlife and beyond  
i think i’ll accept anything  
as long as i have you  

*To my second love: Thank you for allowing me to reason again, without discarding what once was.*
