After seven years, I [left]((https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-deepmind)) Google with nothing but some cool snacks. Now, only faint muscle memory remains: wiring up eval pipelines, kicking off model training runs. My experience would help me do something similar inside another company, but thousands of competent engineers could replicate my work. All my projects and the actual code I wrote now fully belong to Google and my former teams.<sup>1</sup>

I envied my husband, who owns his research papers and ideas as he hops from institution to institution. His value is affiliation-agnostic. If he walked away from his career tomorrow to do *God knows what*, he would still retain recognition for the impact he’s already made. In comparison, my entire engineering career felt like being a cog in a machine—still crucial to the broader system’s functioning, but lacking in intellectual richness. We were in the same high-pressure industry. I put in a similar number of hours and endured comparable levels of stress. Didn’t I deserve the same kind of recognition?

I also became utterly indignant whenever I read about tragic events involving a Google employee (or any well-known company employee). Journalism effectively compresses lives into one-liners: *“Google engineer on [team, sometimes] dies of [unfortunate circumstances].”* All the hard work, the long hours, the years spent climbing the corporate ladder, yet the public summary remains the same. Well, maybe not entirely—at staff (L6+), the label might upgrade to *“Google manager,”* and at director (L8+), to *“Google executive.”*

I don’t expect news articles to recount anyone’s entire life story or personality quirks. In typical headlines, the *average* person becomes *“Man,” “Mother of 3,” or “Bay Area teenager.”* Get into Google (or another prestigious tech company), and your identity becomes your position. I understand this is a significant accomplishment and that these people are *extraordinary* individuals who deserve respect. Yet it still feels like they are reduced to their association with *Prestigious Tech Company*, because almost no one outside cares about the specifics of their contributions. *Extraordinary Individual* becomes nothing more than a job label, albeit an esteemed one, with all their efforts vanishing into the corporate black hole.

Suddenly, I felt rebellious. I wanted to make art. I wanted to run away and start a flower farm in the countryside. I wanted to have kids and bake pastries all day. I craved anything that would make me feel more human in this stifling tech bubble. The past seven years of my life suddenly felt wasted, and I had no idea what to do with myself.

I’m not blaming Google. This feels like the inevitable nature of software engineering work in large companies: it is mass-procured and mass-produced. I’m also not judging my former coworkers or anyone currently there. Google is an excellent place to work (I make this clear in my [post](https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-deepmind)), and tech is one of the best industries for a career, offering high compensation and *relative* stability. The advancement of technology is one of humanity’s most remarkable journeys, and everyone working in tech plays some role in it, no matter the size.

I recognize the importance of my work over the past seven years. I’m also deeply thankful to Google for providing me with a comfortable life and access to brilliant people. But now, I want *more*. I want to stand out, even slightly, from the hundreds of thousands of highly competent and highly comparable people around me. In an increasingly computerized society, I want to feel a bit more *human*.<sup>2</sup>

In this next chapter, I’m starting a new quest to find deeper meaning in my life. I keep wondering whether that makes me selfish. I suspect it’s just human instinct. For as long as we’ve kept records, people have tried to leave something behind. I think most of us share the desire to be remembered for our efforts, to leave a mark among the hundreds of billions who have existed here. Perhaps, more than anything, my quest is to answer that urge: to live intentionally, so that my days echo beyond their end.


### Footnotes

1. I know you can technically take screenshots of your code/design docs. But if your work is anything of importance and you get caught, have fun with a hefty lawsuit and possibly imprisonment! Just look at what’s happening in the AI industry.

2. I imagine this is a common sentiment, especially as AI advances toward human-grade intelligence or even AGI. We want to distinguish ourselves from the robots, to make our lives feel meaningful and worthwhile.
