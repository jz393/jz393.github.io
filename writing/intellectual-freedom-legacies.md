After 7 years, I [departed](https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-deepmind) Google with nothing but some cool snacks. Now, only the faint muscle memory of completing eval pipelines and model trainings remain. My experience would enable me to recreate something parallel if I joined a different company in a comparable role, though thousands of competent engineers could also replicate my work. However, all my projects and the actual code I wrote now fully belong to Google and my former teams<sup>1</sup>.

I envied my husband, who got to own his research papers and ideas as he capriciously hopped from one institution to the next. His value was affiliation-agnostic. If he abandoned his career to do *God knows what*, he would still retain recognition for the impact he made. In comparison, my entire engineering career felt nothing more than a cog in the machine—still crucial to the broader system’s functioning, but lacking in intellectual richness. Being in the same high-pressure industry, I put in a similar number of hours and endured comparable levels of stress. Didn’t I deserve the same recognition?

Furthermore, I became indignant upon reading any news headline regarding a tragic event involving a fellow Google *(or any well-known company)* employee. Not to sound morbid, but journalism effectively reduces deaths to one-liners: *Google engineer on [occasional team reference] dies of [unfortunate circumstances].* All the hard work and time spent climbing the corporate ladder, yet the outcome is the same. Well, maybe not entirely. At staff (L6+), the reference possibly upgrades to *‘Google manager’*, and at director (L8+), *‘Google executive’*.

I’m not expecting news articles to cover your entire life story and personality quirks. In typical headlines though, an *average* person is referred to as *“Man”*, *“Mother of 3"*, or *“Bay Area teenager”*. Get into Google (or another prestigious tech company), and you become your position. I understand this is a significant accomplishment belonging to an *extraordinary* individual deserving of such recognition. However, it feels like they are *reduced* to their association with *Prestigious Tech Company*, since no one really cares about the specifics of their contributions. *Extraordinary Individual* is nothing but a title, albeit an esteemed one, with their hard work vanishing into the corporate black hole. 

Upon this realization, I felt rebellious. I wanted to make art. I wanted to run away and start a flower farm in the countryside. I wanted to have kids and bake pastries all day. I desperately craved anything to make me feel somewhat more human in this stifling tech bubble. The past 7 years of my life seemed entirely wasted, and I had no idea what to do with myself anymore.

Now I’m not blaming Google. I think this is just the inevitable nature of SWE work, both mass-procured and mass-produced inside the industry. I’m also not judging my former coworkers or anyone who is currently working there. Google is undoubtedly a wonderful company to work for (I make this clear in my [post](https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-deepmind)), and the tech industry is one of the best places for a career, offering excellent compensation and (relative) stability. Besides, the advancement of technology is one of humanity's most remarkable journeys *(if not the most)*, and every individual working in tech plays a role in it, no matter the size.

Reflecting back, I recognize the importance of my work over the past seven years. I’m also incredibly thankful to Google for providing me with a comfortable life and wonderful connections. But now, I long for *more*. I want to stand out *just a tad* from the hundreds of thousands of highly comparable and competent individuals around me. In an increasingly computerized society, I just want to feel a bit more human<sup>2</sup>.

In this next chapter, I begin a novel quest to attain deeper meaning in my life. I can’t help but ponder, *am I selfish*? I think it’s the human instinct. Since the beginning of history, I believe deep down, we’ve all shared the desire to be remembered for our efforts, to leave a mark among the hundreds of billions who have also existed here. Perhaps, more than anything, my quest is to answer that very urge: to live intentionally, so that my days echo beyond their end.

### Footnotes

1. Yes, I know you can technically take screenshots of your code/design docs. But if your work is anything of importance and you get caught, have fun with a hefty lawsuit and possibly imprisonment! Just look at what’s happening in the AI industry.

2. I imagine this is a common sentiment, especially as AI advances toward human-grade intelligence or even AGI. We want to distinguish ourselves from the robots, to make our lives feel meaningful and worthwhile.
