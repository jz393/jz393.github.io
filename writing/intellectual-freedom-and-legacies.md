<!-- 11/21/25: NO MORE CHANGES -->

After seven years, I took nothing with me when I [left]((https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-and-deepmind)) Google (except the snacks, of course). Now, I have only a faint memory of building eval pipelines and kicking off training runs. My vague recollection could help me accomplish something similar inside another company, but thousands of competent engineers could also replicate my work. All my concrete projects, along with the code I wrote, now fully belong to Google and my former teams.<sup>1</sup>

I envied my husband, who got to own his research papers and ideas as he capriciously hopped from one institution to the next. His value is affiliation-agnostic. If he abandoned his career tomorrow to do *God knows what*, he would still retain recognition for the impact he made. We belonged to the same industry, putting in a similar number of hours and enduring comparable levels of stress. Didn’t I deserve the same kind of recognition?

I also became enraged whenever I read about tragic events involving a fellow Google employee (or any well-known company employee). Journalism tends to compress lives—and their unfortunate endings—into one-liners: *“Google engineer on [occasional reference to team] dies of [circumstances].”* All the hard work, long hours, and years spent climbing the corporate ladder, yet the end result is the same. Well, maybe not entirely: at staff (L6+), that label might upgrade to *“Google manager,”* and at director (L8+), *“Google executive.”*

I don’t expect news articles to recount anyone’s life story or personality quirks. In typical headlines, the *average* person becomes *“Man,” “Mother of 3,” or “Bay Area teenager.”* But the minute you get into Google (or another prestigious tech company), your identity becomes your position. I understand this is a significant accomplishment belonging to *extraordinary* individuals who deserve such recognition. Yet it feels like they are wholly reduced to their association with *Prestigious Tech Company*, because almost no one outside cares about the specifics of their contributions. *Extraordinary Individual* becomes nothing but a title, albeit an esteemed one, with all their efforts vanishing into the corporate black hole.

Suddenly, I felt rebellious. I wanted to make art. I wanted to run away and start a flower farm in the countryside. I wanted to have kids and bake pastries all day. I craved anything that might make me feel more human in this stifling tech bubble. The past seven years of my life felt completely wasted, and I had no idea what to do with myself anymore.

I’m not blaming Google. This feels like the inevitable nature of engineering work in large companies, both mass-procured and mass-produced. I’m also not judging my former coworkers or anyone currently there. Google is an excellent place to work (I make this clear in my [post](https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-and-deepmind)), and tech is one of the best industries for a career, offering high compensation and *relative* stability. The advancement of technology is one of humanity’s most remarkable journeys, and everyone in tech plays some role in it, no matter the size.

I recognize the importance of my work over the past seven years. I’m also deeply thankful to Google for providing me with a comfortable life and access to brilliant people. But now, I want *more*. I want to stand out, even slightly, from the hundreds of thousands of highly competent and comparable people around me. In an increasingly computerized society, I want to feel a bit more *human*.<sup>2</sup>

In this next chapter, I begin a new quest to attain deeper meaning in my life. I can’t help but ponder, *am I selfish*? I suspect it’s just human instinct. For as long as we’ve kept records, people have tried to leave something behind. I think most of us share the desire to be remembered for our efforts, to leave a mark among the hundreds of billions who have also existed here. Perhaps, more than anything, my quest is to answer that very urge: to live intentionally, so that my days echo beyond their end.

### Footnotes

1. I know you can technically take screenshots of your code/design docs. But if your work is anything of importance and you get caught, have fun with a hefty lawsuit and possibly imprisonment! Just look at what’s happening in the AI industry.

2. I imagine this is a common sentiment, especially as AI advances toward human-grade intelligence or even AGI. We need to distinguish ourselves from the robots in order to feel meaningful and worthwhile.
