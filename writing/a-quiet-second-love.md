the incandescent glow of youth  
under luscious willow trees  
riding bikes by the lake  
you comforted me when i scraped my knee  

we eventually grew up  
we gossiped about scandals  
we mocked haughty politicians  
we questioned our existence  

fearing a Shakespearean tragedy  
i said i had to go  
and you let me  
i left before i could look back  

thousands of miles away  
i met someone else  
still, i remembered you  
in ancient libraries beneath decrepit books  

nearly a decade later  
my first destroyed me  
ashes and embers in my hair  
i believed i would never breathe again  

empty thoughts, empty ambitions  
months of mindless distractions  
aimlessly wandering downtown  
i noticed you in a small cafe  

we caught up quickly  
i spoke for the first time  
i laughed for the first time  
you rebuilt without erasing  

no longer eighteen and naive  
i know love does not guarantee  
but with you, the present is frozen  
in cycles of stories and sketches  

we can rewrite Romeo and Juliet   
we can avert the ending  
anything is possible  

as long as  
i have  
you  


*To my second love: Thank you for making life worth living again.*
