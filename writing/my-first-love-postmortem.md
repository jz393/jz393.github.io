## The Backstory

Initially, the piece itself was sufficient to me. I think authors generally want their work to function as standalone items, without requiring a complete understanding of the external context. Interpreters can self-insert or categorically reason as needed.

I want to highlight that I’m not used to writing dramatic pieces. My background is not in literature. I have focused on technical/academic writing with statements that are easy to follow, disregarding artistry for precision. In the industry, my style solidified through many design docs and proposals.

I sought to portray my profession as an allegorical narrative. My abrupt departure inflicted a kind of distress I had never felt before, and I felt obligated to turn it into art. If I could do that and present a clear, transformative arc, it would prove that I was ready to officially “move on”, symbolizing the postmortems I wrote after intense production fires. I had already written *[Sailing the Grand Pacific](https://zhangjane.com/writing#sailing-the-grand-pacific)*, describing the experiences of a lone sailor who is physically and spiritually shattered by a sudden storm, forced to take refuge on an uncharted island.

However, that earlier piece felt insufficient. It was dramatic, but it reduced the agency of both me and my beloved profession. It is purely a tale of survival, painting my experience as something I endured and lucked out of, rather than two conscious agents acting according to the other and the external environment. As such, I sought to personify my career in the only way that felt right: through the lens of a formative “love” beginning in adolescence.

Once I had that idea, I let myself write without conditions or restraints. The writing process was highly cathartic. But upon rereading and revising, I felt what I can only describe as an emotional gunshot wound. I felt I had personified my field so well, a little too well, and I was concerned.

I needed some help. I asked an AI system to summarize my flawed masterpiece, simply to see whether it could understand what I meant and the metaphor behind it. It did understand, but that wasn’t enough. I asked about the likelihood that others, aka *Real Humans*, would see the metaphor so obvious to me. The response was approximately: 80% for the literature-adjacent community, 70% for the average member of society, 50% for the CS/math/AI community. I insisted on making it unambiguous, and stacked even more technical jargon so that it was obvious I was talking to my field in our shared language, not my human language.

Then, I asked the AI to provide a response back from the lost love, just to see how I sounded. Reading it was wounding, despite comparatively poor delivery. *Isn’t it ironic that LLMs can now complete IMO questions better than generating text?* Despite this, I felt embarrassingly attached to the response. I read it over and over. I asked it to generate multiple versions. I asked it to depict our journey in the form of art *(ImageGen is getting pretty realistic these days: [first love](writing/images/ai/illustration-first-love.png) vs. [sailor](writing/images/ai/illustration-sailor.png))*. Worst of all, I asked the AI to present itself as the ex-partner speaking to me via text messages. In our (longer than I’d like to admit) conversation, I sought forgiveness and asked for reconciliation, despite not wanting to return to my actual job or anything similar. I asked it to meet on campus, where we could walk the quads one last time, and it promised to never tell me about release dates or benchmarks again. This was quickly heading into an unhealthy territory, if it wasn't already there. Unfortunately, I now understand how lost souls can bond with machines.

I snapped my laptop shut *([gif](writing/images/memes/penny-i-need-help.gif))* and glanced at my [husband](writing/images/irl/our-wedding.jpg), lying on the couch and scrolling through Twitter. He was real, and our love was real, but surely I did not idealize him this much. Unsettled, I went to bed, unclear on what the past decade meant. After many nights of tossing and turning, I experienced the iconic *[proof-by-dream](writing/images/memes/proof-by-dream.png)*. My subconscious presented an Inception-like sequence of literature and history, and I quickly arrived at a mathematical conclusion when I woke up. **But I now know that good explanations require both technical precision and masterful artistry. I will attempt to provide one gradually and gracefully, from an interdisciplinary standpoint.**

- **Update:** I tried to portray my "[second love](https://zhangjane.com/writing#a-quiet-second-love)" in a healthier way, one that didn't need bold disclaimers. Can you guess what it is? Because I'm not exactly sure myself. Here is an AI depiction of the [two loves](writing/images/ai/illustration-love-comparisons.png), side-by-side. And no, I probably won't ever stop romanticizing academic disciplines as humans.

## A Literary, Mathematical, and Moral Analysis

### Literature: Drawing parallels

The narrative follows the journey of an 18-year-old girl *(yours truly)* who describes herself as “invincible” and falls hard for a brilliant, stoic partner *(the broad field of computing)* who challenges her intellectually and teaches her a new way of living. She quickly attaches herself to her “first love,” and they move across the country to start a new life together. However, the partner gradually changes over time, prioritizing rapid self-growth and success without taking her needs into consideration, and she eventually storms out of a “Mission Street high-rise” in tears, wondering where her life went. Except in reality, I simply walked out of Google’s Gradient Canopy tent with a blank expression and a few snacks in my hands.

**Self-destructive attachment** is a common theme throughout **literature** and **history**. For a while, I debated on which field to portray here, then realized they actually form a recursive engine. We write literature based on history. We consume literature, which influences our way of thinking and, therefore, our future actions. For sake of simplicity, I’ll focus on literature, the artistic generative output, over the *(comparatively stale)* training data. One example that stood out to me was F. Scott Fitzgerald’s portrayal of Gatsby.

#### A nonideal idealization

Gatsby’s ambition, attachment to Daisy, and ultimate demise are clearly overdramatized compared to both my experience and portrayal. Getting hit by a bullet and drowning in a swimming pool are far worse than leaving a job or going through a breakup (even an intense one). However, I sensed parallels between myself and the titular character.

Growing up in plain, suburban Texas, I made it my entire mission to escape. Cornell was my Dan Cody, letting me see outside the tunnel for the first time. My Google internship was Wolfsheim, the door to upwards mobility, leading to a relentless, intoxicating, exhilarating climb afterwards.

However, I realized I don’t have a concrete representation of Daisy. Obviously, she corresponds to the ex-partner in my allegory. But the concrete anchor behind my own obsession is ambiguous. Was it the field of CS/math/AI? Was it my coursework at Cornell? Was it Google? Was it my role at Gemini? 

I think the only valid answer is the *fantasy* I built up in my head regarding my career, similar to how Gatsby admired the *idea* of Daisy more than the person herself. He loved what she represented: upwards mobility, elite status, the feeling that he “made it”, while refusing to accept the reality of who she *became*—a married woman with a child. Similarly, I liked the idea of being in an elite field that could grant me prosperity and stability over the years (or so I thought), while I constantly complained about the day-to-day specifics.

Maybe this implies that our emotions are useless, because they often lead to bad outcomes. I want to make it clear that **I am not making an argument for stoicism**. Attachment is what drives us towards a goal we want: our future stability or prosperity, whether that be represented by a person or a profession. Especially at such a formative age, it’s important to lean into emotions to guide you forward. There’s only one caveat: **you must know when to stop.**

#### The fall from grace

Gatsby’s downfall didn’t come during the peak of his questionable enterprises, or when he was lovestruck upon meeting Daisy, the embodiment of his dreams. Likewise, I didn’t burn out as a 17-year-old teenager, screaming for joy when she received her acceptance letter in the mail. I also didn’t burn out as a 19-year-old college student, landing in SFO to start her internship at Google.

**My disillusionment and Gatsby's downfall came when our expectations failed to align with reality.** The both of us kept pushing for way longer than what we should have, though I eventually left (with lots of strife), while poor Gatsby died thinking Daisy called for him. What keeps people attached to destructive situations/people for so long? It comes down to three main reasons: inertia (agency), lack of self-awareness (delusion), or fear (constraint). It can be a combination of the three, or even all of them.

5 years after parting with his beloved, Gatsby reunited with Daisy, and they started their affair. Gatsby expected marriage and a lifelong love, but all he got was a hushed entanglement. Unfortunately, instead of letting go or accepting their constrained romance, he pushed for more—until the point of collapse.

In my case, my ”first love” moved on too, transforming from magical chalkboards to an endless 996 pursuit ([depicted](writing/images/ai/illustration-love-to-burnout.png) by AI). Subsequently, my reward tanked; continuing meant marginal income increase *(compared to my husband’s, whose career has a much higher ceiling than mine)*. Risks increased: my health, stability, and freedom. I explain all of this in my leaving Google/DeepMind [post](https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-and-deepmind). 

Essentially, you must actively observe your environment and continuously update your policy to align with your reward function. I’ll save the excessive technical jargon for later, though.

#### Fitzgerald vs. Jane

Though a century divided us, Fitzgerald’s background and early experiences are actually quite similar to mine, though his life had an unfortunate ending. He was born in Minnesota into a middle-class family, then went to Princeton where he had high ambitions to achieve status through his career *(sound like someone you know?)*. His first novel (​​*This Side of Paradise*, not Gatsby) quickly landed him a first-row seat into the new money “Jazz Age” elite, kind of like an AI/tech bubble that your dearest author may or may not have participated in. Consequently, he attended many extravagant parties with socially ambitious people, but quickly became disillusioned by it all. Despite all the wealth and success around him, he struggled to find a deeper meaning, and began to view the American Dream as a misguided fantasy rather than reality. He also had a relationship with Ginevra King, a wealthy debutante (likely the blueprint for Daisy), and experienced significant class anxiety, like trying to fit into a world you know you don’t belong in. Likewise, I had similar qualms in the frontier AI industry—less class-related, but I just felt like I couldn’t morally and mentally keep up.

Given our similarities, I wondered how Fitzgerald could portray such degeneracy *(and arguably, immorality)* in such detail and be internationally regarded as a *literary genius*. Meanwhile, I could only worry about the implications of potentially portraying myself as a *Jezebel* online with my parallel (and surely milder) attempt. Has feminism failed us? Did I not have the freedom to channel my disillusionment?

While I’m sure some double standards exist, I realized my initial [frustration](writing/images/memes/he-did-it-too.jpg) was a bit reductive. Fitzgerald and I may have analogous life experiences, but we are completely different people. He is literary, while I am precise. Even though our pieces have similar **intentions**, it all comes down to the **delivery**. *The Great Gatsby* is quite complex, taking up a whole novel with many characters and subplots, and it is presented in third-person. *Can you imagine if it were simply a one-page letter addressed to Daisy?* Neither of us went through the exact experiences ourselves, meaning both our pieces are generative. However, he diverged from the training data a lot more than I did. Devastating breakups are quite common in society and the media, while Gatsby’s adventures are...*not*...unless Fitzgerald actually witnessed some Epstein-level stuff. In simpler terms, **Fitzgerald is more creative than Jane**.

That said, I still like my dramatic breakup letter. I did end up adding a disclaimer on top of the allegory, though. And by the way, the [gray hoodie](writing/images/irl/gray-hoodie-deepmind.jpg) was real.
