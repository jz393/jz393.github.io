After 7 years, I took absolutely nothing away from Google when I [left](https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-deepmind). Inside the vast, intricate organization, I took pride in the eval pipelines I owned, the model optimizations I trained, and clever algorithms I programmed. My efforts helped my teams significantly, leading to various launches, bonuses, and promotions over the years. Four painstaking years of studying computer science in college (plus all the foundational stuff that preceded my university days) had made all my contributions possible.

However, when I handed over my badge and walked out of Google’s beautiful office, I realized I had nothing anymore. All the meticulously crafted components, designed and implemented through a combination of strategic planning, late nights, and endless mental gymnastics, became completely *irrelevant* as I decided to embark on a new and unknown journey. I kept only the vague recollection of my thought processes from then. Now, my former experience would enable me to recreate something parallel if I joined a different company in a comparable role (though thousands of competent engineers could also replicate my work). Nevertheless, all my projects and the actual code I wrote now fully belong to Google and my former teams<sup>1</sup>.

I envied my husband, who got to own his research papers and end-to-end ideas as he ever-so-capriciously hopped from one institution to the next. His value was affiliation-agnostic; if he paused or even abandoned his career to do *God knows what*, he would still retain recognition for the concepts he formulated and the impact he made. In comparison, my entire engineering career felt nothing more than a cog in the machine—still crucial to the broader system’s functioning, but lacking in intellectual richness. Being in the same high-pressure industry, I put in a similar number of hours and endured comparable levels of stress. Didn’t I deserve to be recognized the same way, rather than reduced to a cog?

Furthermore, I became indignant whenever I read any news headline regarding a tragic event involving a fellow Google employee (or any employee of a well-known company, for that matter). Not to sound morbid, but journalism effectively reduces deaths to one-liners: *Google engineer on [occasional reference to team] dies of [unfortunate circumstances]*. All these years, all the hard work and time spent climbing the corporate ladder, yet it’s all the same. Well, maybe not *entirely* the same; at staff (L6+), the reference possibly upgrades to *‘Google manager’* and at director (L8+), *‘Google executive’*.

I’m not expecting news articles to cover your entire life story and personality quirks; just the quick basics. But inside your typical headline, an *average* person is typically referred to as something like *“Man”*, or *“Mother of 3”*, or *“Bay Area teenager”*. Suddenly, when you get into Google or some other *Prestigious Tech Company*, you are now referred to by your position. The argument here is that this is a significant accomplishment and that the individual is *extraordinary*, deserving such recognition. Now this makes sense, but at the same time, it feels like they are reduced to their association with *Prestigious Tech Company*, since it’s not like anyone cares about the specifics of their contributions. The extraordinary individual becomes nothing but a title, albeit an esteemed one, with their hard work vanishing into the corporate black hole.

Upon this realization, I felt rebellious. I wanted to make art. I wanted to run away and start a flower farm in the countryside. I wanted to have kids and bake artisan breads/cakes all day. I desperately craved anything to make me feel somewhat more human in this stifling tech bubble. The past 7 years of my life seemed entirely wasted, and I had no idea what to do with myself anymore. Everything was so futile, and I just wanted to redirect my efforts towards something that could last.

​Now don’t get me wrong; I’m not blaming Google. I think this is just the inevitable nature of SWE-type work, which is both mass-produced and mass-procured at tech corporations (there are thousands of online postings for SWE jobs at Google, all requiring a similar skill set and involving similar responsibilities). I’m also not judging my former coworkers or anyone who is currently working there. Google is undoubtedly a wonderful company to work for (I make this clear in my [post](https://zhangjane.com/writing#why-i-left-google-deepmind)), and the tech industry is one of the best places for a career, offering excellent compensation and (relative) stability for bright, innovative minds. The advancement of technology is one of humanity's most remarkable journeys *(if not the most)*, and every individual working in tech plays a role in it, no matter how big or small.

Ultimately, I am proud of the work I've done over the past seven years, the lessons I’ve learned, and the connections I’ve made. I’m also incredibly thankful to Google for providing me with a comfortable life and financial stability. But now, I long for something *more*. I want to create something lasting, personal, and memorable that makes me stand out *just a tad* from the hundreds of thousands of highly comparable and competent individuals around me. I’m not demanding to be widely known or revered; I just want to feel a bit more human in an increasingly computerized society<sup>2</sup>.

In this next chapter, I begin a novel quest to attain deeper meaning in my time-bound life. I’m not exactly sure which medium(s) will allow me to achieve this—whether through a job, in the domestic sphere, or through my other hobbies and interests. I’m also grateful that my situation provides me the resources and freedom to embark on this journey. Now I can’t help but ponder, *am I selfish*? I don’t think so; I think it’s the human instinct. Since the birth of human history, I believe deep down, we’ve all shared the desire to be remembered for our efforts, to leave a mark (no matter how tiny) among the hundreds of billions who have also existed here. Perhaps, more than anything, my quest is to answer that very urge: to live with intention, so that my days echo beyond their end.

### Footnotes

1. Yes, you can *technically* take screenshots of your code and (secretly) bring them to your next company. But if your work is anything of importance and you get caught, have fun with a hefty lawsuit and possibly imprisonment! Just look at what’s happening these days in the AI industry.

2. I imagine this is a common sentiment, especially as AI advances toward human-grade intelligence or even AGI. We want to distinguish ourselves from the robots, to make our lives feel meaningful and worthwhile.
