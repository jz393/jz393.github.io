My middle school English class first introduced me to the concept of predestination. My teacher, *bless her heart*, made twenty preteens sit in a circle and do a full-fledged Socratic seminar on which ideology, predestination or free will, aligned more with reality. As you might expect, things were messy and intense.

Obviously, my optimistic 13-year-old self preferred the idea of free will. I wanted to write my own destiny. I wanted to believe that if I worked hard enough, I could do anything I set my mind to.​

However, I couldn’t come up with a legitimate counterproof for predeterminism. What if we are inherently limited by our genes, and all our “hard work,” *if it even succeeds in the first place*, is just merely a result of what would’ve happened anyway?

When I got home that day, I experienced the feeling of *depression* for the first time. This was different from normal *sadness*, which, as I had learned, was just a temporary emotion that would pass with the situation. This was an overwhelming sensation of hopelessness, knowing I didn’t have the power to change it. I could only learn to live with it.

Enter high school, a busier environment where I didn’t have time to think about such frivolous things. I enjoyed being freed from my burdensome thoughts and relished the routine of optimizing for a single metric: grades. Despite this, I often found myself in the dark corners of the Internet—forums where bitter, resentful men vented all their existential frustrations on a single subject: women.

I know what you’re thinking: *“That couldn’t have been good for a teenage girl!”* While it definitely wasn’t, my younger self enjoyed reading the perspectives of people who were vastly different from me. It’s like getting to live a different life, without actually dying and reincarnating, if that’s even possible. I had always chalked up their words as “ramblings of the lunatics,” viewing them as entertainment rather than reality.

One idea I retained, though, was the concept of the *“blackpill”*. Basically, it reinforces my earlier fear of fatalism. *Blackpilled* individuals believe that they are born with their limitations *(looks, intelligence, social ability, etc.)*, which predetermines life outcomes *(such as their inability to find a suitable mate)*. However, instead of spiraling into depression, many took that as a sign to bask in *hedonism*, believing that if they couldn't change the outcome, they might as well enjoy life in the meantime.  I was baffled. How could the same concept that drove me into despair drive others into eternal bliss?​

As I got older, I realized I adopt both mindsets selectively, depending on the situation. If there’s something I really want right in front of me? *“Hard work conquers all.”* Something I only *kind of* want, but don’t really care that much to go out of my way and get? *“It is what it is.”​*

Then, I moved to SF (well, the broader Bay Area), an environment defined by founder/hustle culture in the age of AI. Suddenly, everything was about *startups. Agency. Startups. Agency.* Not to sound dramatic, but I wanted to drive off a cliff every time I heard those words. I was perfectly content working a stable 9-5, and didn’t want to hear about my lack of “drive” or the fact that I was merely a “corporate wage-slave”.

Eventually, I left my job and had some time to think about what I really wanted out of life. The founders are right: maybe I don’t have what it takes to build a successful B2B-SaaS LLM wrapper from the ground up and raise a $100M seed round. But maybe it’s not what I want either, and I am okay with that.

While startup culture typically defines agency as reckless ambition and social dominance, I think we can expand that definition to the “general ability to influence life outcomes to the point of one’s own satisfaction.” Using my definition, I don’t need to be *inauthentic* to exert agency in my own life. I just need to be able to understand and distinguish between my wants, needs, and limitations.

I believe I’m genuinely happy right now. Of course, I don’t expect this feeling or state to last forever. But if things do change, I have faith in myself, *given my 26 years of knowledge and experience*, to steer my life to a better state—one characterized by more *internal* contentment and fulfillment.

*To my younger self: Things are going to be okay. Just get off the damn Internet.*
