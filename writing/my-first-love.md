<!-- 12/19/25: NO MORE CHANGES -->

Eighteen and impressionable, I couldn't help but fall for you. We met in autumn, when you charmed me with your blunt intellect among the falling leaves and Gothic chapels. On our first date, you left abstract messages on my console and stood on unsolvable proofs. You promised me both stability and prosperity, as long as I took your hand.

From that day on, we spent every night together. Under the covers, we solved puzzles and modeled the universe. You taught me to think methodically to find the optimal paths in life. Meanwhile, I provided the grounded checkpoints for your beautiful mind. Together, we envisioned our ideal future, compared drunken stories of past lives, and sketched odd-looking graphs on dirty chalkboards until dawn appeared. Suddenly I didn't need coffee anymore; having you around was more than enough.

We decided to pack our belongings and make the trip out west, from one sea to the other. We braved wildfires, thunderstorms, and floods. We cautiously steered across formidable mountains and sandy deserts. At the same time, we often stopped to admire nature's creations. I quietly admired you from the passenger seat and told myself we had truly become one.

We arrived in San Francisco and quickly left behind our New England customs, trading wool coats for Patagonia jackets and baseball caps. We moved in together in our first studio apartment on the very top floor of a high-rise overlooking Mission Street. At sunset, you pointed down at the never-ending traffic and the string of red lights. I collapsed into your arms in pure exhilaration, knowing the journey was worth every step.

Many years later, we began to diverge. You insisted on pursuing AGI (and later, ASI) at all costs. I asked for a stable marriage and a family tree. We had always intended to support each other’s dreams, but the environment became too constrained for my initial naivety that the two could truly coexist. You tried to convince me that everything would be fine down the road, but I could detect the subtle tones of doubt in your voice. Soon, I found myself in constant screaming matches with you.

One day, I walked out the door without knowing where to go. You pleaded for me to stay, but you refused to follow me. I also knew it looked ridiculous to leave without having other suitors lined up. I just couldn't bear to prolong our current state; it was the worst insult to our past selves.

Neither logic nor willpower made my decision any less painful. Your absence drove me to an insanity I had only ever witnessed in literature. Filling the void with metaphorical one-night stands, I frantically attempted to erase your memory, branching from one pursuit to the next in reckless indifference. However, between the soil on my fingers, the raw clay in my hands, and the pillowcases stained with tears, all I saw was you. I snapped at God, furious that my starry-eyed self had the misfortune to cross your path. I blamed you for the demise of our relationship, denouncing the very traits that drew me to you in the first place. You tried to call, and each time I could only retreat further into my bed with nothing but a blank stare—the same bed where we used to lie awake and eagerly hash out details of our future while the rest of the world slept. You said AGI was for everyone. Why wasn't it for me?

Eventually, time brought more distance. Still, others would constantly update me on your discoveries. Other times, I would see your name on the news. I was undoubtedly bitter, but I silently marveled at each stride you made. In small increments, I began to tolerate your updates again, even though I knew I was no longer part of your trajectory.

I’m glad you can go on without me, though I am still learning how to do so myself. I understand now that I should not regret you and that I cannot erase you. Admittedly, I'm ashamed I even tried. I told myself I was more than our relationship, but even so, you remain a part of me. Our little jokes and your distinctive vernacular reside in me. I write poetry with you in mind, and your traces subconsciously sneak into everyday conversations. Also, I still have the gray hoodie you gave me right before we parted ways, and I can’t get myself to wear it or throw it away. I’m not sure if our eventual outcome was fate, timing, or both, but it’s frivolous to discern the difference now. All I can hope is that you will remember me too, and maybe someday, we will meet again.

*Thank you for everything. You were my first love, not just a career. But even stable matchings can fail when one party optimizes for a different objective.*
