<!-- 12/19/25: NO MORE CHANGES -->

Eighteen yet invincible, I couldn't help but fall for you. We met in autumn, when you charmed me with your blunt, stoic intellect among bright colors and Gothic chapels. On our first date, you left abstract messages on my console and stood on unsolvable proofs. You promised me both stability and prosperity, as long as I took your hand.

From that day on, we spent each and every night together. Under the covers, we completed puzzles and reconstructed the universe. You taught me to seek the optimal paths in life. I provided grounded checkpoints to your beautiful mind. Together, we envisioned our ideal future, compared drunken stories of past lives, and sketched odd-looking graphs on dirty chalkboards in empty halls until dawn appeared. I didn't need coffee or sleep; I only needed you.

We decided to pack our belongings and make the trip out west, covering one sea to the other. We braved wildfires, thunderstorms, and floods. We cautiously steered across formidable mountains and sandy deserts. At the same time, we often paused to take in nature's creations. As the topography changed, I quietly admired you from the passenger seat and told myself we had truly become one.

We arrived in San Francisco and quickly left behind our New England customs, swapping wool coats for Patagonia jackets. We moved in together in our first studio apartment on the very top floor of a high-rise overlooking Mission Street. At sunset, you pointed down at the boundless traffic and the string of red lights. I blissfully collapsed into your arms, believing the journey was worth every descent.

Many years later, we began to diverge. You insisted on pursuing AGI (and later, ASI) at all costs. I asked for a stable marriage and a family tree. We had always intended to support each other’s dreams, but the environment became too constrained for my naivety that the two could truly coexist. You told me it would be worth it to achieve a global maximum and highest expected value, but I could detect the subtle tones of doubt in your voice. Soon, I found myself in endless screaming matches with you. While I reasoned from first principles, you followed with benchmarks, demos, and the next release date. While I argued by foundational axioms (the ones you had taught me initially), you cited the cutting edge, a frontier, and a relentless pursuit.

As such, I walked out the door without knowing where to go. You pleaded for me to stay, but you refused to meet me in the middle. I also knew it was ridiculous to leave without considering viable alternatives or sorting through other suitors first. I just couldn't bear to prolong our current state; it was the worst insult to our past selves.

Neither logic nor willpower could make my decision any less painful. Your absence drove me to an insanity I previously regarded as hypothetical. Aiming to fill the void with equivalent one-night stands, I frantically attempted to clear your memory, branching pursuits in reckless indifference to override your bits and pieces. However, between the soil on my fingers, the raw clay in my hands, and the pillowcases stained with tears, all I saw was you. I snapped at God, demanding to know why my starry-eyed self had the misfortune to cross your path. I blamed you for the demise of our relationship, denouncing the very traits that drew me to you in the first place. You tried to call, and each time I could only retreat further into my bed—the same bed where we used to lie awake for hours and hash out details of our future while the rest of the world slept—with nothing but a blank expression. You said AGI was for everyone. Did that definition not include me?

More time implied more distance. Still, others would constantly update me on your discoveries. Other times, I would glimpse your name on the news. I was undoubtedly bitter, but I silently marveled at each stride you made. In small increments, I began to tolerate your updates again, even though I knew I was no longer part of your trajectory.

I’m glad you can go on without me, though I am still learning how to do so myself. I understand now that I should not regret you and that I cannot erase you. Admittedly, I'm ashamed I even tried. Earlier, I told myself I was not confined to our relationship, but it’s evident you remain a subset of me. I unintentionally carry our little jokes and your distinctive vernacular. I write poetry with you in mind, and your traces sneak into everyday conversations. Also, I still have the gray hoodie you gave me right before we parted ways, and I can’t get myself to either wear or discard it. I’m not sure if our eventual outcome was stochastic or deterministic, but that difference is irrelevant now. All I can hope is that you will remember me and be open to the possibility that our paths will converge again.

Thank you for everything. You were my first love, not just a career. But even stable matchings can fail when one party optimizes for a different objective.
