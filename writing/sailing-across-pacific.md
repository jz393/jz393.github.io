I wasn’t sure what awaited, or if a true destination even existed. The vibrant blue waters simply captivated me, as did legends of past adventurers. On the other hand, some warned that the journey would be onerous.

I studied my sailing path for years, meticulously mapping my journey. I devoted my life to constructing my sailboat, trusting it to carry me through rough waters. I consulted renowned cartographers, astronomers, and artisans in preparation.

One day, I got tired of all the endless planning. So, on a random Tuesday, I took the leap of faith, said goodbye, and set sail. I experienced the first rush of adrenaline, so free for once in the boundless waters. Next to me, dolphins leaped into the air, and colorful fish followed closely behind. I felt the wind in my hair and the sunlight on my face. Nothing had ever felt so right.

Months later, I spot a dark cloud above. *I’m sure it’ll pass*, I thought. Then another appears, and a few drops of rain fall onto my hands. Nothing to worry about—I know meteorology and can handle some rain.

Suddenly, the storm engulfs everything. Lightning strikes ferociously, winds shred my sails, and waves batter the hull. I throw my body onto the planks, hoping to keep the water out *just a little longer*. For the first time, I start to resent those who successfully sailed before me and those who remain safe back at shore.

Finally, lifeboats begin to appear, giving me a sense of relief. I intended to jump into one, confident that it would take me home, where I could erase the entire ordeal from my memory. Upon closer inspection, each boat seemed flimsy compared to my own *imperfect but beautifully crafted* masterpiece. I didn't trust a single one to carry me out of this gruesome storm. Furthermore, I couldn’t bear to part with my beloved vessel—my pride and joy since the early days of youth, spent dreaming about electrifying adventures ahead.

Therefore, I ultimately chose to stay with my ship, preparing for the worst. I do nothing but hopelessly watch as it yields to the relentless force of nature. Day after day, we drift amid the tempest, my despair deepening with each passing minute. I close my eyes and lie flat on the plywood, submitting to fate.

Between the flashes of lightning, I open my eyes and spot a faint shadow illuminated in the background—a small island in the Pacific. With my sails ruined, I lean over and pitifully use my arms as oars. I don't know if I can make it, but it's still worth a try. Flailing them with all my remaining strength, I reach the sandy shore, exhausted and battered.

I lie down on a makeshift bed, consisting of an arrangement of knocked-over palm leaves under a lush cover of trees. Sleep doesn’t come easily, as I still vividly hear and feel the crashing waves, akin to how sailors oddly get seasick *after* they arrive on land. After what seemed like days, I managed to doze off. A warm glow of sunlight seeps through the canopy as I awaken.

The storm eventually passes, and I wander out of the burrow. I sip coconut water, play with friendly tropical monkeys, and watch whales from afar. I build a simple hut and gradually begin repairing my ship. Each evening, I admire the sunset on the secluded beach and enjoy lasting moments of tranquility for the first time in years. I glance back at the remnants of my map and realize this island was never on here. However, I am happy to have discovered it.

My little enclave is lovely, and I adore my new life. However, as I gradually recover from the shipwreck, my curiosity returns. Time after time, my mind clears, and I forget all the negative emotions that once consumed it. By the cliffside, I glance down at the breathtaking turquoise waters, wanting to venture out again to discover *more*.
