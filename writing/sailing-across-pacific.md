I wasn’t sure what awaited, or if a true destination even existed. The vibrant blue waters simply captivated me, as did legends of past adventurers. Some warned that the journey would be difficult.

I studied my sailing path for years, meticulously mapping my journey. I devoted my life to my sailboat, trusting it to carry me through rough waters. I consulted renowned cartographers, artisans, and astronomers in preparation.

One day, I got tired of the endless planning. So, on a random Tuesday, I took the leap of faith, said goodbye, and set sail. I experienced the first rush of adrenaline, so free for once in the boundless waters. Next to me, dolphins leaped into the air and tropical fish followed closely behind. I felt the wind in my hair and the sunlight on my face. Nothing had ever felt so right.

Months later, I spot a dark cloud above. *I’m sure it’ll pass*, I thought. Then another appears, and a few drops of rain fall onto my hands. Nothing to worry about—I know meteorology and can handle some rain.

Suddenly, the storm engulfs everything. Lightning strikes ferociously, winds shred my sails, and waves batter the hull. I throw myself onto the planks, hoping to keep the water out for a while. For the first time, I start to resent those who successfully sailed before me and those who are safe back at shore.

Eventually, lifeboats begin to appear, giving me a sense of relief. I intended to jump into one, confident that it would take me home, where I could erase the entire ordeal from my memory. Upon closer inspection, the boat seemed flimsy compared to my own *flawed but beautifully crafted* counterpart. I didn't trust it to carry me out of this gruesome storm. Furthermore, I couldn’t bear to part with my own vessel—my pride and joy since the early days of youth, spent dreaming about electrifying adventures ahead.

Therefore, I ultimately chose to stay with my ship. I can do nothing but hopelessly watch as it yields to the relentless force of nature. Day after day, we drift amid the tempest, my despair deepening with each passing minute. I close my eyes and lie flat on the plywood, waiting for fate to take me.

Between the lightning strikes, I open my eyes and spot a faint shadow illuminated in the background—a small island in the Pacific. With my sails ruined, I lean over and pitifully use my arms as oars. I don't know if I can make it, but it's still worth a try. Flailing them with all my remaining strength, I reach the sandy shore, exhausted and battered.

I spend my first few days lying down in a makeshift bed, made of an arrangement of knocked-over palm leaves under a lush cover of trees. Sleep doesn’t come easily, as I still vividly hear and feel the crashing waves, similar to how sailors oddly get seasick *after* they arrive on land. Eventually, I doze off and wake up to a warm glow of sunlight seeping through the branches above me.

The storm eventually passes, and I wander out of the burrow. I sip coconut water, play with friendly tropical monkeys, and watch whales from afar. I build a simple hut and gradually make repairs to my ship. Each evening, I admire the sunset on the secluded beach and enjoy lasting moments of tranquility for the first time in years. I glance back at the remnants of my map and realize this island was never on here. However, I am happy to have discovered it.

My little enclave is so lovely, and I adore my new life in it. However, as I gradually recover from the shipwreck, my curiosity appears again. Time after time, my mind clears, and I forget all the negative emotions that once consumed it. By the cliffside, I glance down at the breathtaking turquoise waters, wanting to venture out again and discover *more*.
