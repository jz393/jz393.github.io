I wasn’t sure what awaited, or if a true destination even existed. The blue water simply called to me, as did legends of past adventurers. Others warned the journey would wear me down.

For years, I studied charts, tracing and retracing every possible route. I built my boat plank by plank, trusting it to survive rough seas. I sought out cartographers, astronomers, and artisans from around the world, trying to seal every crack in my plans.

Eventually, I found myself running in circles with the endless planning. On a random Tuesday, I finally said goodbye and set sail. The first rush of open water hit me like a revelation. Dolphins leaped beside the bow; bright fish flickered underneath. Wind tore through my hair, and sunlight warmed my face. For a while, everything felt exactly right.

Months later, a dark cloud edged into view. I told myself it would pass. Then another followed, and cool drops of rain grazed my palms. I brushed off the unease. *I knew enough meteorology*, I thought. I could handle rain.

The storm arrived without restraint. Lightning tore open the sky, winds shredded my sails, and waves hammered the hull. I threw myself against the leaking planks, straining to keep the water out for *just a few more minutes*. Others had supposedly crossed these waters; why was I the only one it swallowed while those back on shore slept so soundly?

At last, lifeboats emerged through the spray and gave me a flicker of hope. I prepared to jump, ready to let them carry me home and erase the voyage as a mistake. But as they drew near, each looked flimsy next to my scarred but carefully built ship. Climbing into one meant entrusting my life to strangers who had never seen the work in my hands. It also meant admitting the boat I’d given my youth to could not save me. *I froze at the thought.*

I stayed. I watched my vessel yield to the storm’s weight, the boards groaning as if apologizing. Day after day, we drifted in the dark, my resolve dissolving into dull resignation. I lay flat on the deck, eyes shut, letting the waves decide whether I would sink or simply vanish into motion.

Between flashes of lightning, I opened my eyes and glimpsed a shadow on the horizon—a small island. I didn’t know if my body or my boat could make it. With the rigging in tatters, I leaned over to the side and used my arms as oars, dragging us forward in clumsy strokes until the keel scraped sand and I collapsed on the shore.

I made a bed from fallen palm leaves beneath a canopy of trees. Sleep came in broken pieces; even on solid ground, I still felt the sea crashing beneath me, the echo of waves rattling through my bones. After several lifetimes of half-dreams, I finally woke to a warm band of sunlight cutting through the leaves.

When the storm moved on, I stepped out of my shelter. I drank coconut water, watched monkeys swing through the branches, and tracked distant whales from the beach. I built a simple hut and began mending my boat, little by little. Each evening, I watched the sky burn out over the water and felt a kind of quiet I hadn’t known since before the first map. Only later did I glance back at the tattered chart, just to realize this island had never appeared on it.

My hidden cove is beautiful, and I’ve grown accustomed to my newfound bliss. But as the wreck fades into memory, my curiosity slowly returns. Standing on a cliffside and peering down at the turquoise water, I feel the familiar pull to leave shore once again.

I start making my way towards my boat when I encounter a strange bottle containing a message. With trembling hands, I reach towards the glass.
