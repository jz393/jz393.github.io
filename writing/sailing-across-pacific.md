The water called to me. I wasn’t sure what was out there, or if a real destination even existed.

I built my boat over the course of many years, entrusting it to carry me through rough seas. I studied the charts and the stars, tracing and retracing every possible route. I sought out cartographers, astronomers, and artisans from around the world just to seal every little detail.

Eventually, I found myself running in circles. So on a random Tuesday, I said goodbye and set sail. The first rush of open water hit me like a revelation. Dolphins leaped beside the bow; bright fish flickered underneath. Wind tore through my hair, and sunlight warmed my face. Nothing had ever felt so right.

Months later, a dark cloud edged into view. I told myself it would pass. Then another followed, and cool drops of rain grazed my palms. I brushed off the unease. *I know enough meteorology*, I thought. I could handle rain.

The storm arrived at once. Lightning tore open the sky, winds ripped apart my sails, and waves hammered the hull. I threw myself against the leaking planks, hoping to keep the water out for *just a few more minutes*.

At last, some lifeboats emerged, giving me a flicker of hope. I braced myself to jump, intending to erase the entire ordeal from my memory as soon as I got home. But as the boats drew closer, I realized each looked flimsy compared to my imperfect masterpiece. I couldn’t bear to part with it. I couldn’t entrust my life to strangers who had never seen the work in my hands. Most of all, I couldn’t admit that the boat I’d given my youth to could not save me.

I decided to stay, slowly watching my beloved vessel yield to the storm’s weight. Day after day, we drifted in the dark. My resolve morphed into dull resignation. I lay flat on the deck with my eyes shut, ready to submit to fate.

Between flashes of lightning, I opened my eyes and glimpsed a shadow on the horizon—a small island. I didn’t know if my body or my boat could make it. With the rigging in tatters, I leaned over to the side and used my arms as oars, dragging us forward in clumsy strokes until the keel scraped sand and I collapsed on the shore.

I made a bed from fallen palm leaves beneath a canopy of trees. Sleep came in broken pieces; even on solid ground, I still felt the sea crashing beneath me, the echo of waves rattling through my bones. After several lifetimes of half-dreams, I finally woke to a warm glow of sunlight cutting through the leaves above.

When the storm moved on, I stepped out of my shelter. My first few steps were wobbly. I sipped coconut water, watched tropical monkeys swing through the branches, and tracked whales from the beach. I built a simple hut and began mending my boat. Each evening, I watched the sky burn out over the water. I glanced back at the remnants of my chart, just to realize this island had never appeared on it.

My hidden cove is beautiful. But as the wreck fades into memory, my curiosity slowly returns. Standing on a cliffside and peering down at the turquoise water, I feel the familiar pull to leave shore once again.

I start making my way towards my boat when I encounter a strange bottle containing a message. With trembling hands, I reach towards the glass.
