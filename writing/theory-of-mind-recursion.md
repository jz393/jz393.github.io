Theory of mind (ToM) is broadly defined as the ability to understand the mental states of others, knowing that it may or may not be different from your own. In humans, it develops early in life and is crucial to our social success (and therefore, our survival). Now this seems like an intuitive concept—clearly, we know that others have thoughts and feelings. However, things get *interesting* when ToM becomes *recursive*.

The infinite “I know you know" concept is humorously modeled by [Friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUN2YN0bOi8). More precisely, I’ll try to define a few concrete “levels” of ToM below:

> **Level 0:** *“I act, and the world reacts.”*  
> In the base case, no theory of mind is present. In humans, this is typically seen only in infants and in cases of severe pathology.  

> **Level 1:** *“I know what I think/want.”*  
> Here, you understand that others have minds, but you don’t actively model them. You default to your own feelings instead.  

> **Level 2:** *“I know what you think/want.”*  
> I believe this is the *minimum level* of social competence, and most adults can integrate it seamlessly into their everyday lives.  

> **Level 3:** *“I know what you think I think.”*  
> This is used in negotiation, strategy, and diplomacy. It requires substantially more effort than level 2.   

> **Level 4:** *“I know what you think I think you think.”*  
> This is extremely cognitively expensive and is only used *very briefly* in high-level strategy, intelligence analysis, and poker/chess psychology.  

> **Level 5+:** *Okay, my brain is breaking now. I can’t spell it out anymore.*  
> Unfortunately, humans have finite working memory. At these levels, we tend to rely on heuristics or equilibria-based modeling.  
> *(i.e., I’m just a simple machine with a stack overflow within an order of 10)*  

Game theory usually converges to equilibria instead of relying on infinite recursion, unlike many computer algorithms. For me, going up the ladder is enough in most situations. While level 2 is sufficient most of the time, I rely on level 3 to parse more complex situations. Level 4 is a bit of a reach; I think I’ve only done this a handful of times, sometimes even with *pen and paper* at hand.

However, I want to highlight that I usually only perform this type of thinking under *optimal* circumstances. Under extreme stress, I can even fall back to lower levels. Only after things stabilized would I regain the capacity to self-reflect: *“Why would I do something like that? That was completely irrational.”* This often led to self-doubt and a desire to withdraw from society, believing I could no longer handle social situations.

With enough time and space, my analytical abilities and confidence would come back, and I would regain the bandwidth for higher-order social integration. I’d get cocky again, and this cycle would repeat over and over, like a nauseating pendulum completely unaffected by gravity. I was confused. Was I socially competent, incompetent, or were my capabilities defined by the constant state of flux?

I did some research and found that it’s normal for this “ToM-modeling” to collapse under pressure. Now this makes sense, because complex social scenarios require a lot of *working memory*—imagine all the graphs and subgraphs present. When we’re under stress, we often need to act quickly, which can lead to *short-circuiting*. The lizard brain overrides the monkey brain. And while I can definitely *plan*, I have a more difficult time *executing*.

Though my younger self had the right idea, I believe it was suboptimal to focus on depth over stability. It may feel good to know your brain can process multiple call stacks at once (intelligence), but it doesn’t matter if it rapidly reverts at the slightest tipping point (stress management). And especially at higher levels, innocuous molehills quickly turn into horrifying mountains.

Maybe the point of life was never to be brilliant, constantly seeking out tsunami waves to ride to flaunt your competence. Maybe we can just show up at the beach with a mimosa in hand, enjoy the views, and be *reliable*. But alas, we will never know.
